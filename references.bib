  abstract = {Digital footprint data is inspiring a new era in population health and wellbeing research. Linking this novel data with other datasets is critical for future research wishing to harness its potential for public good. In order to do this, successful collaboration among industry, academics, and policymakers is vital. Therefore, this Viewpoint discusses the benefits and obstacles for these stakeholder groups in using digital footprints data. We advocate for policymakers' inclusion in research efforts, stress the exceptional potential of digital footprints research to impact policymaking, and explore the role of industry as data providers with a focus on shared value and streamlined processes. We underscore the importance of multidisciplinary approaches and ethical considerations in navigating challenges related to novel data linkages, and call for increased public engagement to enhance acceptability of digital footprints research. Finally, we highlight the significance of reproducibility and sharing of learnings, and advocate for collaboration as a critical factor in fostering the widespread use of digital footprint data. Incorporating these principles will ensure that the transformative potential of digital footprint data is fully harnessed, establishing a foundation for reproducible, ethical, and impactful research in this groundbreaking field.},

  abstract = {Reliably measuring individual differences in attention control has posed a challenge for the field. This paper reports the development and validation of three 90-s tests of attention control, dubbed the ``Squared'' tasks: Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared. The three Squared tasks demonstrated great internal consistency reliability and test--retest reliability, strong evidence for convergent validity with other measures of attention control, and explained a majority of the positive manifold and variance in multitasking ability. The three Squared tasks can be administered online via web browser, EPrime, or as standalone programs for Mac and Windows (https://osf.io/7q598/). The three Squared tasks demonstrate that it is possible to reliably measure attention control at the observed and latent level by avoiding the use of response time difference scores. Furthermore, the measures reveal that individual differences in attention control can be represented as a unitary latent factor that is highly correlated with complex cognitive task performance.},

In a choice RT task, Ss pressed the right- or left-hand key in response to the words "right" or "left" which were presented to the right or left ear. RT was significantly faster when the content of the command corresponded to the ear stimulated than when it did not, i.e., information processing was affected by a cue irrelevant to the task itself, the ear in which the command was heard. Removing S's uncertainty regarding the ear to be stimulated resulted in significantly faster RT, and reduced but did not eliminate the effect of the irrelevant directional cue.

  abstract = {The association between depression and digital media use (DMU) has received substantial research and popular attention in recent years. While meta-analytic evidence indicates that there is a small, positive relationship between DMU and depression, almost all studies rely on self-report measures of DMU. Evidence suggests these measures are poor reflections of usage measures derived from digital trace data. Additionally, a recent study showed that the error in self-reported DMU is likely biased systematically by factors that are fundamental to the effect being investigated: respondents' volume of use and level of depression. The present study harnesses cubic response surface analysis---a novel analytical approach in this domain---to advance our understanding of how inaccuracies in self-report measures of DMU can be explained by respondent attributes, in this case their level of depression and actual iPhone usage. A sample of 325 iPhone users provided estimates of their total iPhone use over the past week, their actual iPhone use as recorded by the Apple Screen Time application, and a measure of their depression. The results of the analysis indicate that depression is (a) more strongly associated with estimated than device-logged DMU; (b) more associated with overestimating than underestimating of DMU; and (c) more associated with inaccuracy at lower versus higher levels of DMU. The findings raise important questions concerning the validity of conclusions in this area and provide insight into the structure of measurement error in self-report estimates of DMU.},

  abstract = {Despite a plethora of research, the link between digital-technology use and psychological distress among young adults remains inconclusive. Findings in this area are typically undermined by methodological limitations related to measurement, study design, and statistical analysis. Addressing these limitations, we examined the prospective, within-persons associations between three aspects of objectively measured digital-technology use (duration and frequency of smartphone use, duration of social-media use) and three aspects of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and social isolation) among a sample of young adults (N = 384). Across 81 different model specifications, we found that most within-persons prospective effects between digital-technology use and psychological distress were statistically nonsignificant, and all were very small---even the largest effects were unlikely to register a meaningful impact on a person's psychological distress. In post hoc subgroup analyses, we found scant evidence for the claim that digital-technology use is more harmful for women and/or younger people.},
