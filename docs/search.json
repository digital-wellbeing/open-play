    "text": "1 Introduction\nScientists widely agree that digital trace data—behavioral logs automatically collected by online platforms—are necessary to understand the nuances of technology use (Freelon 2014; Griffioen et al. 2020), and thereby its effects on varied outcomes such as health, wellbeing, academic achievement, and cognition (Burgess et al., n.d.). Users struggle to accurately self-report even high-level measures of use (e.g., total screentime) (Parry et al. 2021), and these high-level metrics are generally poorly predictive of outcomes (Orben 2019). To systematically understand the effects of technology, we therefore need data that captures nuanced factors we now know to be more impactful. Beyond screentime, the next layer of granularity includes the frequency, duration, and time of day of each session; the specific content engaged; and the trajectory of user behavior over time. Digital trace data is well-suited to deliver these elements.\nAs one of the world’s foremost leisure activities among youth and adults alike (Ofcom 2023; Entertainment Software Association 2024), video games are a key medium for which digital trace data is needed. Digital trace data has been widely implemented in many studies of social media and wellbeing, but in studies of video games has been much more limited. Trace data in video games primarily falls under the field of game analytics or game data science, but (1) the majority of these studies involve the use of proprietary data that is not publicly shared, and (2) the focus of this field tends to be more on player behavior metrics with clear industry value .\ni In part, this is a function of availability: video game consoles are restrictive and typically do not allow third party tracking software; most video game platforms do not have a 1-click “download my data” option offered by several social media platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram); and there are thousands of individual games whose data may be relevant for a given study or population.\nWhere trace data has been used in video games studies, it has largely been limited to a single game (Vuorre et al. 2022; Johannes, Vuorre, and Przybylski 2021; Larrieu et al. 2023; Perry et al. 2018) or platform (Ballou et al. 2023, 2025) per user. Previous studies that secured video game telemetry was widely limited to a single game or a single gaming platform. However, as the data we present here shows, players commonly use a wide range of games and platforms. Capturing just one game or one gaming platform among potentially many that the person may be engaging with—and affected by. For example, a player may\nDigital trace data on its own is limited however; without additional information from users about how their lives are going, we will struggle to understand the causal network. In the field of game analytics, a number of studies have digital trace data to explore social networks, We therefore see particular value in longitudinal studies that combine comprehensive digital trace data with repeated surveys, in both experimental and observational contexts. Ideally, surveys should be frequent enough to capture short-term effects (e.g., playing a game to recover from a stressful workday) and longer-term development (e.g., a pattern of increasing play over time displacing sleep).",

    "text": "3.1 Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Participant flow during study intake.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study consisted of four stages (Figure 3.1).\n\n3.1.1 Stage 1: Screening\nIn the first stage, we screened participants in order to find people aged 18-40 who (1) self-report playing video games, (2) self-report that at least 50% of their total video game play takes place on the platforms included in the study, and (3) were willing to link their gaming accounts to provide digital trace data. We screened participants from two panel sources: PureProfile and Prolific.\nParticipants were recruited under an initial set of ethnicity‐based quotas designed to mirror the general population’s demographic composition. After we reached approximately 50% of our target sample under quota constraints and found that further quota‐eligible recruits were scarce, we suspended the quotas for the remainder of data collection; all subsequent participants were enrolled on a first‐come, first‐served basis. Final sample characteristic reflect both quota‐driven and open‐enrollment phases (see below).\n\n\n3.1.2 Stage 2: Account Linking\nParticipants who were deemed eligible during screening proceeded directly to an account linking survey wherein they provided details of the gaming platforms they actively use. For UK participants, this includes Nintendo Switch, Steam, Android and iOS. For US participants, this includes the same four alongside Xbox. Details of how participants linked each type of account are shown in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: : Platform Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nData Source\nAccount Linking Process\nType of Data Collected\n\n\nNintendo\nData-sharing agreements with Nintendo of America (US) and Nintendo of Europe (UK)\nParticipants share an identifier contained within a QR code on Nintendo web interface.1 Nintendo of America/Europe uses this identifier to retrieve gameplay data and share it with the research team.\n\nSession records (what game was played, at what time, for how long) for 1st party games (games published in whole or in part by Nintendo, but not by third party publishers such as Electronic Arts).2\n\n\nXbox (US only)\nData-sharing agreement with Microsoft\nParticipants consent to data sharing by opting in to the study on Xbox Insiders3 with their Xbox account. Microsoft retrieved gameplay data for all consented accounts, and shares it with the research team in pseudonymized form.\nSession records (what game was played, at what time, for how long). The name of the game replaced with a random persistent identifier for all third-party games (i.e., those not published by Xbox Game Studios), but genre(s) and age ratings are shared.\n\n\nSteam\nCustom web app (Gameplay.Science)\nParticipants sign up for Gameplay.Science (https://gameplay.science), an o pen-source platform for tracking Steam gameplay. Participants consent to have their gameplay data monitored for the duration of the study. Their Steam ID is authenticated using the official Steam authentication API (OpenID).\nIncremental playtime per game (every hour, the total time spent playing during the previous hour)\n\n\niOS\niOS Screen Time Screenshots\nIn each biweekly survey, participants submitted screenshots from the built-in iOS Screen Time app. These show details of the previous 3 weeks’ of gaming app use (what games were played and for how long). Data was extracted using OCR.\nTotal weekly playtime per game (e.g., 2 hours on game X, 5 hours on game Y)\n\n\nAndroid\nDigital Wellbeing Screenshots\nIn each biweekly survey, participants submitted screenshots from the Digital Screen Time app, if available on their Android OS. These show details of the previous 3 weeks’ of phone use (what app categories are used and for how long). Data was extracted using OCR.\nTotal weekly playtime per game (e.g., 2 hours on game X, 5 hours on game Y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Stage 3: Account Validation\nAfter players completed the account linking process, we checked each account for evidence of valid gaming—specifically, records of active gameplay sessions on one or more of Steam, Xbox, and Nintendo within the 2 weeks before survey completion. Participants who did not have recent, valid telemetry on any console platform were excluded from the rest of the study.\n\n\n3.1.4 Stage 4: Surveys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2\n\n\n\n\n\nEligible participants were invited to complete 6 waves of biweekly surveys, one every two weeks (Figure 3.2). US participants were additionally invited to complete daily surveys for 30 days, concurrently with the first biweekly surveys. During waves 1, 3, and 5, a cognitive task was also administered within the biweekly survey.\nDaily survey links were sent every day at 2pm local time for the participant and remained available until 3am. Biweekly survey links were sent every second week from the first day of the study at 12pm and remained available for 96 hours.",

    "text": "5.2 Future Work\nThe trace data presented here is broad in scope but limited in granularity: we capture all gaming activity on a given platform, but not what happens within individual games. Prior work and theory make clear that in-game behaviors (e.g., what role a player adopts, whether they compete or cooperate, or how they perform in competitive modes) are critical determinants of player experience and thereby wellbeing (see e.g., Elson et al. (2014) for a review of how in-game contexts shape effects). This highlights a fundamental trade-off in digital trace research between breadth—how comprehensively play can be captured across platforms—and depth—the granularity of in-game behaviors and experiences. At present, our dataset emphasizes breadth, but we see strong potential in future study designs that combine platform-level telemetry with targeted in-game behavioral data to provide a more complete picture.\nWe also see strong potential in combining digital trace data with experimental designs that enable stronger causal inference—for example, randomizing players to single-player games only, or restricting play to certain times of day, to examine effects on social wellbeing or sleep. Previous researchers have noted a dearth of digital trace data-backed field experiments, while highlighting their potential (Stier et al. 2020): Trace data not only captures naturalistic gaming behavior but also allows researchers to assess substitution (what games or platforms participants switch to under intervention) and adherence (how closely they follow assigned play patterns).",
