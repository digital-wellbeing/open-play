title: |
  A longitudinal dataset of multi-platform video game digital trace data and psychological assessments
abstract: |
  A major limitation to understanding digital technology use, and its potential psychological consequences, is the lack of sufficiently detailed, multidimensional, and accurate data. We present a dataset of X individuals' video game play telemetry data from Nintendo Switch, Steam, and Xbox, paired with psychological assessments across multiple dimensions of mental health, motivations, well-being, and cognitive ability. The data were collected over 12 weeks that included fourteen daily assessments, six biweekly surveys, three biweekly cognitive tests, and play telemetry for X months. The data include X hours of video game play across X titles, X responses to X survey instruments, and X attention ability measures to facilitate examining longitudinal associations between play behaviors and psychological functioning. Data and codebook are available under LICENSE at LINK.

# Introduction

Scientists widely agree that digital trace data---behavioral logs automatically collected by online platforms---are necessary to understand the nuances of technology use [@Freelon2014Interpretation; @GriffioenEtAl2020improveda], and thereby its effects on varied outcomes such as health, wellbeing, academic achievement, and cognition [@BurgessEtAl2024Potential]. Users struggle to accurately self-report even high-level measures of use (e.g., total screentime) [@ParryEtAl2021systematic], and these high-level metrics are generally poorly predictive of outcomes [@Orben2019Teens]. To systematically understand the effects of technology, we therefore need data that captures nuanced factors we now know to be more impactful. Beyond screentime, the next layer of granularity includes the frequency, duration, and time of day of each session; the specific content engaged; and the trajectory of user behavior over time. Digital trace data is well-suited to deliver these elements.

As one of the world's foremost leisure activities among youth and adults alike [@Ofcom2023Online; @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024], video games are a key medium for which digital trace data is needed. Digital trace data has been widely implemented in many studies of social media and wellbeing, but in studies of video games has been much more limited. Trace data in video games primarily falls under the field of game analytics or game data science, but (1) the majority of these studies involve the use of proprietary data that is not publicly shared, and (2) the focus of this field tends to be more on player behavior metrics with clear industry value .

i In part, this is a function of availability: video game consoles are restrictive and typically do not allow third party tracking software; most video game platforms do not have a 1-click "download my data" option offered by several social media platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram); and there are thousands of individual games whose data may be relevant for a given study or population.

Where trace data has been used in video games studies, it has largely been limited to a single game [@VuorreEtAl2022Time; @JohannesEtAl2021Video; @LarrieuEtAl2023How; @PerryEtAl2018onlineonly] or platform [@BallouEtAl2023Gaming; @BallouEtAl2025Perceived] per user. Previous studies that secured video game telemetry was widely limited to a single game or a single gaming platform. However, as the data we present here shows, players commonly use a wide range of games and platforms. Capturing just one game or one gaming platform among potentially many that the person may be engaging with---and affected by. For example, a player may

Digital trace data on its own is limited however; without additional information from users about how their lives are going, we will struggle to understand the causal network. In the field of game analytics, a number of studies have digital trace data to explore social networks, We therefore see particular value in longitudinal studies that combine comprehensive digital trace data with repeated surveys, in both experimental and observational contexts. Ideally, surveys should be frequent enough to capture short-term effects (e.g., playing a game to recover from a stressful workday) and longer-term development (e.g., a pattern of increasing play over time displacing sleep).

# Overview

This paper addresses this need for longitudinal digital trace data across multiple gaming platforms. Here, we present a dataset consisting of `r n_participants` participants, `r n_daily` daily surveys, `r n_biweekly` surveys, and a total of `r n_hours` of gameplay distributed across `r n_sessions`.

Digital trace data was sourced for five distinct platforms—Xbox, Nintendo, Steam, iOS, and Android—through distinct piplines detailed below.

The dataset is openly available at \[LINK\] under a CC0 license for unrestricted reuse.

The study consisted of four stages (@fig-sankey).

### Stage 1: Screening

In the first stage, we screened participants in order to find people aged 18-40 who (1) self-report playing video games, (2) self-report that at least 50% of their total video game play takes place on the platforms included in the study, and (3) were willing to link their gaming accounts to provide digital trace data. We screened participants from two panel sources: PureProfile and Prolific.

Participants were recruited under an initial set of ethnicity‐based quotas designed to mirror the general population’s demographic composition. After we reached approximately 50% of our target sample under quota constraints and found that further quota‐eligible recruits were scarce, we suspended the quotas for the remainder of data collection; all subsequent participants were enrolled on a first‐come, first‐served basis. Final sample characteristic reflect both quota‐driven and open‐enrollment phases (see below).

### Stage 2: Account Linking

Participants who were deemed eligible during screening proceeded directly to an account linking survey wherein they provided details of the gaming platforms they actively use. For UK participants, this includes Nintendo Switch, Steam, Android and iOS. For US participants, this includes the same four alongside Xbox.

[^data-ms-3]: https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/guide-to-insider-program

### Stage 3: Account Validation

After players completed the account linking process, we checked each account for evidence of valid gaming—specifically, records of active gameplay sessions on one or more of Steam, Xbox, and Nintendo within the 2 weeks before survey completion. Participants who did not have recent, valid telemetry on any console platform were excluded from the rest of the study.

### Stage 4: Surveys

```{r}
#| label: fig-design

knitr::include_graphics("figures/design.png")
```

Eligible participants were invited to complete 6 waves of biweekly surveys, one every two weeks (@fig-design). US participants were additionally invited to complete daily surveys for 30 days, concurrently with the first biweekly surveys. During waves 1, 3, and 5, a cognitive task was also administered within the biweekly survey.

Daily survey links were sent every day at 2pm local time for the participant and remained available until 3am. Biweekly survey links were sent every second week from the first day of the study at 12pm and remained available for 96 hours.

```

Our final sample consists of `r nrow(intake[intake$qualified,])` qualified participants, selected from a pool of `r nrow(intake)` screened participants. Of the `r nrow(intake[intake$qualified,])` with recent telemetry, `r length(unique(panel$pid))` also completed at least one survey.

Our screening sample was roughly representative of the general population of the US and UK by ethnicity (@fig-representative) and gender identity: `r gender_text_all`.

The sample of qualified participants is less representative of the general population, containing more men and non-binary participants: `r gender_text_qualified`, as well as fewer black participants (@fig-representative). However, the demographics of console video game players are not well-understood; it is likely that our sample more closely represents this population than the general population.

## Ethics and Compensation

This study received ethical approval from the Social Sciences and Humanities Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (OII_CIA_23_107). All participants provided informed consent at the start of the study, including consent to their data being shared openly for reanalysis.

Prolific participants were paid at a rate of £12/hour for all study components, which equates to: £0.20 for a 1-minute screening, £2 for the 10-minute intake survey (plus £5 for linking at least one account with recent data), £0.80 for each 4-minute daily survey, and £2 for each 10-minute biweekly survey. Participants received £10 bonus payments for completing at least 24 out of 30 daily surveys and/or 5 out of 6 biweekly surveys.

## Deviations from Preregistration

We made several deviations from our preregistration to ensure we could recruit enough high-quality participants to meet our sample size goals. In our view, none are so severe enough to threaten the validity of the study. Deviations are summarised in @tbl-trait.

## Demographic measures

We collected the following demographic variables:

-   age
-   gender

For all participants who were eligible based on self-reported video game play (but who did not always successfully linked accounts), we additionally collected the following

-   ethnicity
-   educational attainment
-   employment status
-   height and weight
-   self-identified neurodivergence (e.g., ASD, ADHD, dyslexia)
-   political party affiliation
-   diagnosed neurodivergence
-   marital status
-   caretaking responsibilities (children, family members)
-   postal geography (general area only; first three digits of the five-digit US ZIP Code; UK outward code)

: Self-report measures in alternating biweekly surveys {#tbl-daily}

### Self-reported play

*Social context of play*: Participants reported which types of social play they engaged in during the last 24 hours (single-player games only, multiplayer with real-world friends, multiplayer with online-only friends, multiplayer with strangers). Participants could select more than one option.

*Self-reported Playtime*: In each biweekly survey, participants estimated the time they spent playing games on platforms they had linked during the study (e.g., excluding other platforms such as Playstation) in each of the following periods: last 24 hours, last 7 days, and last 14 days.

*Self-reported recent sessions:* In each biweekly survey, participants reported details of at least 1 and up to 3 of their most recent gaming sessions (game, date, and start/end time).

## Digital Trace Data

As described above, we collected video game play data from five platforms: Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, iOS, and Android (full details in @tbl-platforms). To recap, on Xbox and Nintendo, we have *session-level* data, characterized by the following fields: a game ID (Xbox) or title (Nintendo), a start and end time, and genre(s). On Steam we have *hourly aggregates* - every hour, how much time people spent playing for all games they played in that hour. On iOS and Android, we have *daily aggregates* - every day, how much time people spent playing each game. We describe each platform in more detail below. For concision, we do not repeat the details of @tbl-platforms in here, but direct readers to that table or our supplementary materials for the exact variables in each platform's trace data.

All telemetry timestamps are stored as UTC, but can be converted to the participant's local time using the `local_timezone` variable.

## Attention Control

In study waves 1, 3, and 5 we measured participants' attention control using the Simon Squared task of @burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023, using modified code from @liceralde23squared. Although the original Squared tasks consist of the Simon, Stroop, and Flanker Squared, due to limited participation time we chose to only use the Simon Squared task as it had the greatest factor loading on attention control in the original study [@burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023].

The Simon Squared task is a short and validated measure of attention control that follows the standard Simon task [@simonAuditorySRCompatibility1967] but is completed in about three minutes. Participants see a target arrow pointing either left or right, with response labels "LEFT" and "RIGHT" printed underneath. Participants then must select the response option (e.g. "LEFT") that matches the arrow's direction (e.g. ◀︎). However, the arrow and response options can appear on either side of the screen, and participants must ignore this spatial configuration and attend only to the symbols' meanings.

After reading the instructions, participants practice for 30 seconds with auditory and text feedback for response accuracy. They then see their score from the practice trials, review the instructions again, and are given 90 seconds to gain as many points as possible. Participants gain one point for each correct response, and lose one point for each incorrect response. After the 90 seconds, the number of correct responses minus the number of incorrect responses is the participant's task score. For a complete task description, see @burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023 and Figure 6 therein.

## Time Use

TODO

## Data Quality Checks

We implemented a variety of data quality checks.

1.  In each daily and biweekly survey, one item from the BANGS (daily) and BPNSFS (biweekly) was duplicated to assess response consistency [@MeadeCraig2012identifying]; participants whose responses to the two identical items differed by more than one scale point were flagged for potential careless responding.
2.  In the telemetry, we use several heuristics to identify potential unreliable sessions: sessions beginning or ending in the future (indicative of clock manipulation or other errors), sessions longer than 12 hours long, 3 or more games being played simultaneously \[TODO: other heuristics\]
3.  In the time use, we flag any cases with fewer than 5 distinct activities logged in a day, or that are missing any

## Missingness

TODO - figure

TODO - text

# Dataset

Here we visualize key aspects of the data to provide an overview of its contents and properties.

@fig-stacked-playtime compares the average self-reported distribution of play across platforms to the distribution in our digital trace data capture. It is vital to note that the self-report data not be treated as ground truth: we have good evidence that people's self-reports of media use are inaccurate [@KahnEtAl2014why; @ParryEtAl2021systematic], with some previous work finding systemic overestimation of video game play [@JohannesEtAl2021Video]. Nonetheless, it is likely that some portion of player's true gaming is systematically uncaptured, due to factors such as missing platforms (e.g., Playstation), missing titles (e.g., Nintendo third party), or player privacy settings (e.g., playing in invisible mode; setting certain games to private on Steam).

In @fig-heatmap, we visualize the distribution of play across days and times. As expected, we find that the likelihood of play peaks on weekends from 8-11pm, and is lowest in the early morning.

Finally, @fig-case-study descriptively visualizes three participants' (in the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of playtime) playtime and wellbeing throughout the study.

Overall, `{r} knitr::combine_words(simon_n$n)` participants completed the Simon task at panel waves 1, 3, and 5. The average performances were approximately 10 points lower than in the in-person study of @burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023 (Figure 16). Participants on mobile devices generally attained lower scores than those not on mobile devices (@fig-simon, rows), but performance was generally stable across the three waves (@fig-simon, columns).

# Discussion

We believe this dataset has potential to address a wide variety of common research questions in the field.

Some of these questions will be addressed in forthcoming registered reports: specifically, we have plans to test (1) key hypotheses from the Basic Needs in Games model [@BallouDeterding2024Basic] about how gaming relates to basic psychological needs over time, (2) the relationship between late-night gaming and sleep, and (3) the relationship between playtime in different genres and wellbeing.

Nonetheless, the richness of this data means that researchers can explore numerous other questions (or, indeed, conduct and compare alternative analysis approaches to the above questions). To stimulate ideas, we present a few questions we think the data are well-suited to answering.

*How do seasons and weather impact playtime?* Because we capture time-stamped play sessions alongside participants’ geographic locations, researchers can merge in high‐resolution weather and daylight data to examine how environmental factors causally influence gaming behavior. Causal inference techniques such as inverse probability weighting can enable precise estimates of how, when, and how much people play in response to seasonal and meteorological changes. By quantifying these effects, researchers can better distinguish weather‐related demand from other drivers (like work schedules or weekend routines), improving the precision of studies on gaming’s impact on wellbeing, motivation, and cognition.

*How do neurotypical and neurodiverse players differ in their gaming behavior?* Using the neurodivergence data we collected (which includes, for example, `r table(intake$neuroIdenCondition_1)[1]` participants who identify as having autism and `r table(intake$neuroIdenCondition_2)[1]` who identify as having ADHD), researchers can. Neurodiversity in games has regularly been studied in the context of specific games and with qualitative methods

Accuracy of self-reported data - inference from other papers

We encourage researchers from a wide range of disciplines to explore these or other questions using the data we present, which is freely available for reuse under a CC0 license.

## Limitations

While this dataset represents a substantial step forward in holistic coverage of video game play, it remains imperfect: we did not capture data on PlayStation (\~19% of gaming market) or computer games played outside the Steam platform (\~11% of gaming market); on Nintendo, we do not have access to third-party titles (`r third_party_prop` of Nintendo play), and our coverage of smartphone play is limited by the difficulties and inconsistencies of screenshot-based donation and OCR retrieval.

We further are unable to identify idle time (when players have a game open but are not actively playing it) and account sharing (when players let friends or family use their account); some playtime values may therefore be overestimates of the person's true playtime, though we are unable to say by how much.

## Future Work

The trace data presented here is broad in scope but limited in granularity: we capture all gaming activity on a given platform, but not what happens within individual games. Prior work and theory make clear that in-game behaviors (e.g., what role a player adopts, whether they compete or cooperate, or how they perform in competitive modes) are critical determinants of player experience and thereby wellbeing (see e.g., @ElsonEtAl2014More for a review of how in-game contexts shape effects). This highlights a fundamental trade-off in digital trace research between breadth—how comprehensively play can be captured across platforms—and depth—the granularity of in-game behaviors and experiences. At present, our dataset emphasizes breadth, but we see strong potential in future study designs that combine platform-level telemetry with targeted in-game behavioral data to provide a more complete picture.

We also see strong potential in combining digital trace data with experimental designs that enable stronger causal inference—for example, randomizing players to single-player games only, or restricting play to certain times of day, to examine effects on social wellbeing or sleep. Previous researchers have noted a dearth of digital trace data-backed field experiments, while highlighting their potential [@StierEtAl2020Integrating]: Trace data not only captures naturalistic gaming behavior but also allows researchers to assess *substitution* (what games or platforms participants switch to under intervention) and *adherence* (how closely they follow assigned play patterns).
