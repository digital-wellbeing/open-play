Users struggle to accurately self-report even high-level measures of use (e.g., total screentime) [@ParryEtAl2021systematic], and these high-level metrics are generally poorly predictive of outcomes [@Orben2019Teens]. To systematically understand the effects of technology, we therefore need data that captures nuanced factors we now know to be more impactful. Beyond screentime, the next layer of granularity includes the frequency, duration, and time of day of each session; the specific content engaged; and the trajectory of user behavior over time. Digital trace data is well-suited to deliver these elements.\n\nAs one of the world's foremost leisure activities among youth and adults alike [@Ofcom2023Online; @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024], video games are a key medium for which digital trace data is needed. Digital trace data has been widely implemented in many studies of social media and wellbeing, but in studies of video games has been much more limited. Trace data in video games primarily falls under the field of game analytics or game data science, but (1) the majority of these studies involve the use of proprietary data that is not publicly shared, and (2) the focus of this field tends to be more on player behavior metrics with clear industry value .\n\ni In part, this is a function of availability: video game consoles are restrictive and typically do not allow third party tracking software; most video game platforms do not have a 1-click \"download my data\" option offered by several social media platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram); and there are thousands of individual games whose data may be relevant for a given study or population.\n\nWhere trace data has been used in video games studies, it has largely been limited to a single game [@VuorreEtAl2022Time; @JohannesEtAl2021Video; @LarrieuEtAl2023How; @PerryEtAl2018onlineonly] or platform [@BallouEtAl2023Gaming; @BallouEtAl2025Perceived] per user. Previous studies that secured video game telemetry was widely limited to a single game or a single gaming platform. However, as the data we present here shows, players commonly use a wide range of games and platforms. Capturing just one game or one gaming platform among potentially many that the person may be engaging with---and affected by. For example, a player may\n\nDigital trace data on its own is limited however; without additional information from users about how their lives are going, we will struggle to understand the causal network. In the field of game analytics, a number of studies have digital trace data to explore social networks, We therefore see particular value in longitudinal studies that combine comprehensive digital trace data with repeated surveys, in both experimental and observational contexts. Ideally, surveys should be frequent enough to capture short-term effects (e.g., playing a game to recover from a stressful workday) and longer-term development (e.g., a pattern of increasing play over time displacing sleep).\n\n# Overview\n\nThis paper addresses this need for longitudinal digital trace data across multiple gaming platforms. Here, we present a dataset consisting of 2.0K participants, 18.8K daily surveys, 6.9K surveys, and a total of 3.4M of gameplay distributed across 5.7M.\n\nDigital trace data was sourced for five distinct platforms—Xbox, Nintendo, Steam, iOS, and Android—through distinct piplines detailed below.\n\nThe dataset is openly available at \\[LINK\\] under a CC0 license for unrestricted reuse.\n\nhighlight that data collection methods are preregistered\n\n# Method\n\n## Design\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Participant flow during study intake.](index_files/figure-html/fig-sankey-1.png){#fig-sankey fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe study consisted of four stages (@fig-sankey).\n\n### Stage 1: Screening\n\nIn the first stage, we screened participants in order to find people aged 18-40 who (1) self-report playing video games, (2) self-report that at least 50% of their total video game play takes place on the platforms included in the study, and (3) were willing to link their gaming accounts to provide digital trace data. We screened participants from two panel sources: PureProfile and Prolific.\n\nParticipants were recruited under an initial set of ethnicity‐based quotas designed to mirror the general population’s demographic composition. After we reached approximately 50% of our target sample under quota constraints and found that further quota‐eligible recruits were scarce, we suspended the quotas for the remainder of data collection; all subsequent participants were enrolled on a first‐come, first‐served basis. Final sample characteristic reflect both quota‐driven and open‐enrollment phases (see below).\n\n### Stage 2: Account Linking\n\nParticipants who were deemed eligible during screening proceeded directly to an account linking survey wherein they provided details of the gaming platforms they actively use. For UK participants, this includes Nintendo Switch, Steam, Android and iOS. For US participants, this includes the same four alongside Xbox. Details of how participants linked each type of account are shown in @tbl-platforms.\n\n+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Platform**   | **Data Source**                                                                   | **Account Linking Process**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Type of Data Collected**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Nintendo       | Data-sharing agreements with Nintendo of America (US) and Nintendo of Europe (UK) | Participants share an identifier contained within a QR code on Nintendo web interface.[^data-ms-1] Nintendo of America/Europe uses this identifier to retrieve gameplay data and share it with the research team.\\                                                                                          | Session records (what game was played, at what time, for how long) for 1st party games (games published in whole or in part by Nintendo, but not by third party publishers such as Electronic Arts).[^data-ms-2]                                           |\n+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Xbox (US only) | Data-sharing agreement with Microsoft                                             | Participants consent to data sharing by opting in to the study on Xbox Insiders[^data-ms-3] with their Xbox account.

Participants who did not have recent, valid telemetry on any console platform were excluded from the rest of the study.\n\n### Stage 4: Surveys\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](figures/design.png){#fig-design fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEligible participants were invited to complete 6 waves of biweekly surveys, one every two weeks (@fig-design). US participants were additionally invited to complete daily surveys for 30 days, concurrently with the first biweekly surveys. During waves 1, 3, and 5, a cognitive task was also administered within the biweekly survey.\n\nDaily survey links were sent every day at 2pm local time for the participant and remained available until 3am. Biweekly survey links were sent every second week from the first day of the study at 12pm and remained available for 96 hours.\n\n## Participants\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/fig-representative-1.png){#fig-representative fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur final sample consists of 2551 qualified participants, selected from a pool of 34229 screened participants. Of the 2551 with recent telemetry, 1973 also completed at least one survey.\n\nOur screening sample was roughly representative of the general population of the US and UK by ethnicity (@fig-representative) and gender identity: Man (16728, 47.7%); Other (535, 1.2%); Woman (16862, 51.1%).\n\nThe sample of qualified participants is less representative of the general population, containing more men and non-binary participants: Man (1659, 65%); Other (158, 6.2%); Woman (734, 28.8%), as well as fewer black participants (@fig-representative). However, the demographics of console video game players are not well-understood; it is likely that our sample more closely represents this population than the general population.\n\n## Ethics and Compensation\n\nThis study received ethical approval from the Social Sciences and Humanities Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (OII_CIA_23_107). All participants provided informed consent at the start of the study, including consent to their data being shared openly for reanalysis.\n\nProlific participants were paid at a rate of £12/hour for all study components, which equates to: £0.20 for a 1-minute screening, £2 for the 10-minute intake survey (plus £5 for linking at least one account with recent data), £0.80 for each 4-minute daily survey, and £2 for each 10-minute biweekly survey. Participants received £10 bonus payments for completing at least 24 out of 30 daily surveys and/or 5 out of 6 biweekly surveys.\n\n## Deviations from Preregistration\n\nWe made several deviations from our preregistration to ensure we could recruit enough high-quality participants to meet our sample size goals. In our view, none are so severe enough to threaten the validity of the study. Deviations are summarised in @tbl-trait.\n\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|

Participants could select more than one option.\n\n*Self-reported Playtime*: In each biweekly survey, participants estimated the time they spent playing games on platforms they had linked during the study (e.g., excluding other platforms such as Playstation) in each of the following periods: last 24 hours, last 7 days, and last 14 days.\n\n*Self-reported recent sessions:* In each biweekly survey, participants reported details of at least 1 and up to 3 of their most recent gaming sessions (game, date, and start/end time).\n\n## Digital Trace Data\n\nAs described above, we collected video game play data from five platforms: Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, iOS, and Android (full details in @tbl-platforms). To recap, on Xbox and Nintendo, we have *session-level* data, characterized by the following fields: a game ID (Xbox) or title (Nintendo), a start and end time, and genre(s). On Steam we have *hourly aggregates* - every hour, how much time people spent playing for all games they played in that hour. On iOS and Android, we have *daily aggregates* - every day, how much time people spent playing each game. We describe each platform in more detail below. For concision, we do not repeat the details of @tbl-platforms in here, but direct readers to that table or our supplementary materials for the exact variables in each platform's trace data.\n\nAll telemetry timestamps are stored as UTC, but can be converted to the participant's local time using the `local_timezone` variable.\n\n## Executive Function\n\nTODO\n\n## Time Use\n\nTODO\n\n## Data Quality Checks\n\nWe implemented a variety of data quality checks.\n\n1.  In each daily and biweekly survey, one item from the BANGS (daily) and BPNSFS (biweekly) was duplicated to assess response consistency [@MeadeCraig2012identifying]; participants whose responses to the two identical items differed by more than one scale point were flagged for potential careless responding.\n2.  In the telemetry, we use several heuristics to identify potential unreliable sessions: sessions beginning or ending in the future (indicative of clock manipulation or other errors), sessions longer than 12 hours long, 3 or more games being played simultaneously \\[TODO: other heuristics\\]\n3.  In the time use, we flag any cases with fewer than 5 distinct activities logged in a day, or that are missing any\n\n## Missingness\n\nTODO - figure\n\nTODO - text\n\n# Dataset\n\nHere we visualize key aspects of the data to provide an overview of its contents and properties.\n\n@fig-stacked-playtime compares the average self-reported distribution of play across platforms to the distribution in our digital trace data capture. It is vital to note that the self-report data not be treated as ground truth: we have good evidence that people's self-reports of media use are inaccurate [@KahnEtAl2014why; @ParryEtAl2021systematic], with some previous work finding systemic overestimation of video game play [@JohannesEtAl2021Video]. Nonetheless, it is likely that some portion of player's true gaming is systematically uncaptured, due to factors such as missing platforms (e.g., Playstation), missing titles (e.g., Nintendo third party), or player privacy settings (e.g., playing in invisible mode; setting certain games to private on Steam).\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nI'm halfway through making changes to the stacked bar chart preprocessing, ignore the actual values.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/fig-stacked-playtime-1.png){#fig-stacked-playtime fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @fig-heatmap, we visualize the distribution of play across days and times.

To stimulate ideas, we present a few questions we think the data are well-suited to answering.\n\n*How do seasons and weather impact playtime?* Because we capture time-stamped play sessions alongside participants’ geographic locations, researchers can merge in high‐resolution weather and daylight data to examine how environmental factors causally influence gaming behavior. Causal inference techniques such as inverse probability weighting can enable precise estimates of how, when, and how much people play in response to seasonal and meteorological changes. By quantifying these effects, researchers can better distinguish weather‐related demand from other drivers (like work schedules or weekend routines), improving the precision of studies on gaming’s impact on wellbeing, motivation, and cognition.\n\n*How do neurotypical and neurodiverse players differ in their gaming behavior?* Using the neurodivergence data we collected (which includes, for example, 432 participants who identify as having autism and 578 who identify as having ADHD), researchers can. Neurodiversity in games has regularly been studied in the context of specific games and with qualitative methods\n\nAccuracy of self-reported data - inference from other papers\n\nWe encourage researchers from a wide range of disciplines to explore these or other questions using the data we present, which is freely available for reuse under a CC0 license.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile this dataset represents a substantial step forward in holistic coverage of video game play, it remains imperfect: we did not capture data on PlayStation (\\~19% of gaming market) or computer games played outside the Steam platform (\\~11% of gaming market); on Nintendo, we do not have access to third-party titles (42% of Nintendo play), and our coverage of smartphone play is limited by the difficulties and inconsistencies of screenshot-based donation and OCR retrieval.\n\nWe further are unable to identify idle time (when players have a game open but are not actively playing it) and account sharing (when players let friends or family use their account); some playtime values may therefore be overestimates of the person's true playtime, though we are unable to say by how much.\n\n## Future Work\n\nThe trace data presented here is broad in scope but limited in granularity: we capture all gaming activity on a given platform, but not what happens within individual games. Prior work and theory make clear that in-game behaviors (e.g., what role a player adopts, whether they compete or cooperate, or how they perform in competitive modes) are critical determinants of player experience and thereby wellbeing (see e.g., @ElsonEtAl2014More for a review of how in-game contexts shape effects). This highlights a fundamental trade-off in digital trace research between breadth—how comprehensively play can be captured across platforms—and depth—the granularity of in-game behaviors and experiences. At present, our dataset emphasizes breadth, but we see strong potential in future study designs that combine platform-level telemetry with targeted in-game behavioral data to provide a more complete picture.\n\nWe also see strong potential in combining digital trace data with experimental designs that enable stronger causal inference—for example, randomizing players to single-player games only, or restricting play to certain times of day, to examine effects on social wellbeing or sleep. Previous researchers have noted a dearth of digital trace data-backed field experiments, while highlighting their potential [@StierEtAl2020Integrating]: Trace data not only captures naturalistic gaming behavior but also allows researchers to assess *substitution* (what games or platforms participants switch to under intervention) and *adherence* (how closely they follow assigned play patterns).\n\n## Data Availability\n\nAll data, materials, and code related to this dataset are available on the Open Science Framework \\[TODO: LINK\\], and the data is archived on Zenodo \\[TODO: LINK\\].\n",
