We present a dataset of 2\\.0K individuals' video game play telemetry data from Nintendo Switch, Steam, and Xbox, paired with psychological assessments across multiple dimensions of mental health, motivations, well-being, and cognitive ability. The data were collected over 12 weeks that included fourteen daily assessments, six biweekly surveys, three biweekly cognitive tests, and play telemetry for X months. The data include X hours of video game play across X titles, X responses to X survey instruments, and X attention ability measures to facilitate examining longitudinal associations between play behaviors and psychological functioning. Data and codebook are available under a {{< meta data-license >}} license at {{< meta data-url >}}.\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\nDigital trace data---behavioral logs automatically collected by digital devices and online platforms---are necessary to better understand technology use and its psychological and health effects [@BurgessEtAl2024Potential; @Freelon2014Interpretation; @GriffioenEtAl2020improveda]. Self-reports of technology use do not accurately reflect objective technology use [@ParryEtAl2021systematic; @sewallRoleDepressionDiscrepancy2021], and are unsuitable for examining many phenomena of interest, such as seasonal patterns over long temporal horizons; high-frequency behavioral analysis at the level of hours, minutes, or even seconds; historical content analysis; and others due to limited accuracy and temporal resolution. Moreover, when technology use's relations to psychological survey instruments are of interest, digital trace data removes the possibility of  common methods bias.\n\nTo combat these issues, digital trace data is increasingly used in studies of smartphone and social media use [e.g. @sewallDoesObjectivelyMeasured2022], but less so in studies of video game play---one of the world's foremost leisure activities [@Ofcom2023Online; @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024]. Trace data in video games primarily falls under the field of game analytics or data science, but (1) the majority of these studies involve the use of proprietary data that is not publicly shared, and (2) the focus of this field tends to be more on player behavior metrics with clear industry value rather than academic inquiry for the common good.\n\nWhere trace data has been used in video games studies, it has largely been limited to a few games [@VuorreEtAl2022Time; @JohannesEtAl2021Video; @LarrieuEtAl2023How; @PerryEtAl2018onlineonly] or single platform [@BallouEtAl2024Registered; @BallouEtAl2025Perceived]. However, players commonly play many games on multiple platforms. Moreover, the scope of psychological attributes in these studies tends to be limited to e.g. a small set of well-being outcomes.\n\n## Current dataset\n\nHere, we present a longitudinal dataset of digital trace data across multiple gaming platforms consisting of 2.0K participants, 18.8K daily surveys, 7.0K surveys, and a total of 1.3M of gameplay distributed across 1.4M. Digital trace data was sourced for five distinct platforms—Xbox, Nintendo, Steam, iOS, and Android—through distinct piplines detailed below. The data collection methods were preregistered as part of a Stage 1 registered report (<https://osf.io/pb5nu>).\n\nThe dataset is openly available under a {{< meta data-license >}} license at {{< meta data-url >}} for unrestricted reuse. @tbl-overview shows a high-level overview of the dataset.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-overview .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Overview of the dataset and sources.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure: set block(breakable: true)\n\n#block[ // start block\n\n  #let style-dict = (\n    // tinytable style-dict after\n    \"0_0\": 0, \"1_0\": 0, \"2_0\": 0, \"3_0\": 0, \"4_0\": 0, \"5_0\": 0, \"6_0\": 0, \"7_0\": 0, \"8_0\": 0, \"0_1\": 0, \"1_1\": 0, \"2_1\": 0, \"3_1\": 0, \"4_1\": 0, \"5_1\": 0, \"6_1\": 0, \"7_1\": 0, \"8_1\": 0, \"0_2\": 0, \"1_2\": 0, \"2_2\": 0, \"3_2\": 0, \"4_2\": 0, \"5_2\": 0, \"6_2\": 0, \"7_2\": 0, \"8_2\": 0, \"0_3\": 0, \"1_3\": 0, \"2_3\": 0, \"3_3\": 0, \"4_3\": 0, \"5_3\": 0, \"6_3\": 0, \"7_3\": 0, \"8_3\": 0, \"0_4\": 0, \"1_4\": 0, \"2_4\": 0, \"3_4\": 0, \"4_4\": 0, \"5_4\": 0, \"6_4\": 0, \"7_4\": 0, \"8_4\": 0, \"0_5\": 0, \"1_5\": 0, \"2_5\": 0, \"3_5\": 0, \"4_5\": 0, \"5_5\": 0, \"6_5\": 0, \"7_5\": 0, \"8_5\": 0\n  )\n\n  #let style-array = ( \n    // tinytable cell style after\n    (fontsize: 0.8em,),\n  )\n\n  // Helper function to get cell style\n  #let get-style(x, y) = {\n    let key = str(y) + \"_\" + str(x)\n    if key in style-dict { style-array.at(style-dict.at(key)) } else { none }\n  }\n\n  // tinytable align-default-array before\n  #let align-default-array = ( left, left, left, left, left, left, ) // tinytable align-default-array here\n  #show table.cell: it => {\n    if style-array.len() == 0 { return it }\n    \n    let style = get-style(it.x, it.y)\n    if style == none { return it }\n    \n    let tmp = it\n    if (\"fontsize\" in style) { tmp = text(size: style.fontsize, tmp) }\n    if (\"color\" in style) { tmp = text(fill: style.color, tmp) }\n    if (\"indent\" in style) { tmp = pad(left: style.indent, tmp) }\n    if (\"underline\" in style) { tmp = underline(tmp) }\n    if (\"italic\" in style) { tmp = emph(tmp) }\n    if (\"bold\" in style) { tmp = strong(tmp) }\n    if (\"mono\" in style) { tmp = math.mono(tmp) }\n    if (\"strikeout\" in style) { tmp = strike(tmp) }\n    if (\"smallcaps\" in style) { tmp = smallcaps(tmp) }\n    tmp\n  }\n\n  #align(center, [\n\n  #table( // tinytable table start\n    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto, auto, auto),\n    stroke: none,\n    rows: auto,\n    align: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"align\" in style { style.align } else { left }\n    },\n    fill: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"background\" in style { style.background }\n    },\n table.hline(y: 1, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 9, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n table.hline(y: 0, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n    // tinytable lines before\n\n    // tinytable header start\n    table.header(\n      repeat: true,\n[Data type], [Participants], [Events], [Hours], [Avg events / participants], [Avg active days],\n    ),\n    // tinytable header end\n\n    // tinytable cell content after\n[Intake survey], [34,168], [34K], [ ], [1.0], [1.0],\n[Daily surveys], [1,297], [19K], [ ], [14.5], [14.5],\n[Biweekly surveys], [1,973], [7K], [ ], [3.6], [3.6],\n[Steam], [1,514], [203K], [168.9K], [134.4], [33.6],\n[Nintendo], [568], [168K], [93.5K], [296.2], [101.8],\n[Xbox], [176], [387K], [480.3K], [2.2K], [603.1],\n[iOS], [95], [4K], [3.7K], [38.2], [33.8],\n[Android], [77], [3K], [3.2K], [33.5], [29.2],\n\n    // tinytable footer after\n\n  ) // end table\n\n  ]) // end align\n\n] // end block\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Method\n\n## Design\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Participant flow during study intake.](index_files/figure-typst/fig-sankey-1.svg){#fig-sankey fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe study consisted of four stages (@fig-sankey).\n\n### Stage 1: Screening\n\nIn the first stage, we screened participants in order to find people aged 18-40 who (1) self-report playing video games, (2) self-report that at least 50% of their total video game play takes place on the platforms included in the study, and (3) were willing to link their gaming accounts to provide digital trace data. We screened participants from two panel sources: PureProfile and Prolific.\n\nParticipants were recruited under an initial set of ethnicity‐based quotas designed to mirror the general population’s demographic composition. After we reached approximately 50% of our target sample under quota constraints and found that further quota‐eligible recruits were scarce, we suspended the quotas for the remainder of data collection; all subsequent participants were enrolled on a first‐come, first‐served basis. Final sample characteristic reflect both quota‐driven and open‐enrollment phases (see below).\n\n### Stage 2: Account Linking\n\nParticipants who were deemed eligible during screening proceeded directly to an account linking survey wherein they provided details of the gaming platforms they actively use. For UK participants, this includes Nintendo Switch, Steam, Android and iOS. For US participants, this includes the same four alongside Xbox. Details of how participants linked each type of account are shown in @tbl-platforms.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-platforms .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Platform Details'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure: set block(breakable: true)\n\n#block[ // start block\n\n  #let style-dict = (\n    // tinytable style-dict after\n    \"0_0\": 0, \"1_0\": 0, \"2_0\": 0, \"3_0\": 0, \"4_0\": 0, \"5_0\": 0, \"0_1\": 0, \"1_1\": 0, \"2_1\": 0, \"3_1\": 0, \"4_1\": 0, \"5_1\": 0, \"0_2\": 0, \"1_2\": 0, \"2_2\": 0, \"3_2\": 0, \"4_2\": 0, \"5_2\": 0, \"0_3\": 0, \"1_3\": 0, \"2_3\": 0, \"3_3\": 0, \"4_3\": 0, \"5_3\": 0\n  )\n\n  #let style-array = ( \n    // tinytable cell style after\n    (fontsize: 0.7em,),\n  )\n\n  // Helper function to get cell style\n  #let get-style(x, y) = {\n    let key = str(y) + \"_\" + str(x)\n    if key in style-dict { style-array.at(style-dict.at(key)) } else { none }\n  }\n\n  // tinytable align-default-array before\n  #let align-default-array = ( left, left, left, left, ) // tinytable align-default-array here\n  #show table.cell: it => {\n    if style-array.len() == 0 { return it }\n    \n    let style = get-style(it.x, it.y)\n    if style == none { return it }\n    \n    let tmp = it\n    if (\"fontsize\" in style) { tmp = text(size: style.fontsize, tmp) }\n    if (\"color\" in style) { tmp = text(fill: style.color, tmp) }\n    if (\"indent\" in style) { tmp = pad(left: style.indent, tmp) }\n    if (\"underline\" in style) { tmp = underline(tmp) }\n    if (\"italic\" in style) { tmp = emph(tmp) }\n    if (\"bold\" in style) { tmp = strong(tmp) }\n    if (\"mono\" in style) { tmp = math.mono(tmp) }\n    if (\"strikeout\" in style) { tmp = strike(tmp) }\n    if (\"smallcaps\" in style) { tmp = smallcaps(tmp) }\n    tmp\n  }\n\n  #align(center, [\n\n  #table( // tinytable table start\n    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto),\n    stroke: none,\n    rows: auto,\n    align: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"align\" in style { style.align } else { left }\n    },\n    fill: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"background\" in style { style.background }\n    },\n table.hline(y: 1, start: 0, end: 4, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 6, start: 0, end: 4, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n table.hline(y: 0, start: 0, end: 4, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n    // tinytable lines before\n\n    // tinytable header start\n    table.header(\n      repeat: true,\n[Platform], [Data Source], [Account Linking Process], [Type of Data Collected],\n    ),\n    // tinytable header end\n\n    // tinytable cell content after\n[Nintendo], [Data\\-sharing agreements with Nintendo of America (US) and Nintendo of Europe (UK)], [Participants share an identifier contained within a QR code on Nintendo web interface.

Biweekly survey links were sent every second week from the first day of the study at 12pm and remained available for 96 hours.\n\n## Participants\n\n\n::: {#tbl-demographics .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Sample demographics for qualified participants with general-population benchmarks (where available).'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure: set block(breakable: true)\n\n#block[ // start block\n\n  #let style-dict = (\n    // tinytable style-dict after\n    \"0_0\": 0, \"1_0\": 0, \"2_0\": 0, \"3_0\": 0, \"4_0\": 0, \"5_0\": 0, \"6_0\": 0, \"7_0\": 0, \"8_0\": 0, \"9_0\": 0, \"10_0\": 0, \"11_0\": 0, \"12_0\": 0, \"13_0\": 0, \"0_1\": 0, \"1_1\": 0, \"2_1\": 0, \"3_1\": 0, \"4_1\": 0, \"5_1\": 0, \"6_1\": 0, \"7_1\": 0, \"8_1\": 0, \"9_1\": 0, \"10_1\": 0, \"11_1\": 0, \"12_1\": 0, \"13_1\": 0, \"0_2\": 0, \"1_2\": 0, \"2_2\": 0, \"3_2\": 0, \"4_2\": 0, \"5_2\": 0, \"6_2\": 0, \"7_2\": 0, \"8_2\": 0, \"9_2\": 0, \"10_2\": 0, \"11_2\": 0, \"12_2\": 0, \"13_2\": 0, \"0_3\": 0, \"1_3\": 0, \"2_3\": 0, \"3_3\": 0, \"4_3\": 0, \"5_3\": 0, \"6_3\": 0, \"7_3\": 0, \"8_3\": 0, \"9_3\": 0, \"10_3\": 0, \"11_3\": 0, \"12_3\": 0, \"13_3\": 0, \"0_4\": 0, \"1_4\": 0, \"2_4\": 0, \"3_4\": 0, \"4_4\": 0, \"5_4\": 0, \"6_4\": 0, \"7_4\": 0, \"8_4\": 0, \"9_4\": 0, \"10_4\": 0, \"11_4\": 0, \"12_4\": 0, \"13_4\": 0, \"0_5\": 0, \"1_5\": 0, \"2_5\": 0, \"3_5\": 0, \"4_5\": 0, \"5_5\": 0, \"6_5\": 0, \"7_5\": 0, \"8_5\": 0, \"9_5\": 0, \"10_5\": 0, \"11_5\": 0, \"12_5\": 0, \"13_5\": 0\n  )\n\n  #let style-array = ( \n    // tinytable cell style after\n    (fontsize: 0.8em,),\n  )\n\n  // Helper function to get cell style\n  #let get-style(x, y) = {\n    let key = str(y) + \"_\" + str(x)\n    if key in style-dict { style-array.at(style-dict.at(key)) } else { none }\n  }\n\n  // tinytable align-default-array before\n  #let align-default-array = ( left, left, left, left, left, left, ) // tinytable align-default-array here\n  #show table.cell: it => {\n    if style-array.len() == 0 { return it }\n    \n    let style = get-style(it.x, it.y)\n    if style == none { return it }\n    \n    let tmp = it\n    if (\"fontsize\" in style) { tmp = text(size: style.fontsize, tmp) }\n    if (\"color\" in style) { tmp = text(fill: style.color, tmp) }\n    if (\"indent\" in style) { tmp = pad(left: style.indent, tmp) }\n    if (\"underline\" in style) { tmp = underline(tmp) }\n    if (\"italic\" in style) { tmp = emph(tmp) }\n    if (\"bold\" in style) { tmp = strong(tmp) }\n    if (\"mono\" in style) { tmp = math.mono(tmp) }\n    if (\"strikeout\" in style) { tmp = strike(tmp) }\n    if (\"smallcaps\" in style) { tmp = smallcaps(tmp) }\n    tmp\n  }\n\n  #align(center, [\n\n  #table( // tinytable table start\n    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto, auto, auto),\n    stroke: none,\n    rows: auto,\n    align: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"align\" in style { style.align } else { left }\n    },\n    fill: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"background\" in style { style.background }\n    },\n table.hline(y: 1, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 14, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n table.hline(y: 0, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n    // tinytable lines before\n\n    // tinytable header start\n    table.header(\n      repeat: true,\n[Variable], [Level], [US Sample %], [US Gen Pop %], [UK Sample %], [UK Gen Pop %],\n    ),\n    // tinytable header end\n\n    // tinytable cell content after\n[Gender], [Man], [64], [49], [71], [49.6],\n[Gender], [Woman], [28.8], [48.9], [24], [49.5],\n[Gender], [Other gender identity], [7.2], [2.1], [5], [0.9],\n[Ethnicity], [White], [63.5], [75.5], [84.8], [81.7],\n[Ethnicity], [Asian], [8.8], [6.3], [7.9], [9.3],\n[Ethnicity], [Two or More Races], [13.9], [3], [4.5], [2.9],\n[Ethnicity], [Black], [9.2], [13.6], [1.9], [4],\n[Ethnicity], [Other], [3.8], [0], [0.8], [2.1],\n[Ethnicity], [American Indian and Alaska Native], [0.6], [1.3], [NA], [0],\n[Ethnicity], [Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander], [0.2], [0.3], [NA], [0],\n[Education], [Completed secondary or less], [59.8], [61], [48.7], [60.1],\n[Education], [Bachelor's degree], [32.8], [24], [35.3], [25.5],\n[Education], [Postgraduate], [7.4], [15], [16], [14.4],\n\n    // tinytable footer after\n\n  ) // end table\n\n  ]) // end align\n\n] // end block\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur final sample consists of 2102 qualified participants, selected from a pool of 34295 screened participants. Of the 2102 with recent telemetry, 1973 also completed at least one survey. On average, participants were. Due to errors in screening, four participants over the age of 40 were included.\n\n@tbl-demographics shows demographic characteristics of the final sample alongside general population benchmarks. Our participants are more likely to be male, non-binary, and bi- or multiracial than the general population. Although the demographics of the population of people who play video games are less well understood, our sample's demographics are broadly consistent with previously reported data [e.g., @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024].\n\nBesides those appearing in @tbl-demographics, we collected various other demographic variables from eligible participants at intake, including employment status, height and weight, self-identified and diagnosed neurodivergence (e.g., ASD, ADHD, dyslexia), political party affiliation, marital status, caretaking responsibilities, and postal geography (general area only; first three digits of the five-digit US ZIP Code; UK outward code). Further details of these are available in the online codebook.\n\n## Ethics and Compensation\n\nThis study received ethical approval from the Social Sciences and Humanities Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (OII_CIA_23_107). All participants provided informed consent at the start of the study, including consent to their data being shared openly for reanalysis.\n\nProlific participants were paid at a rate of £12/hour for all study components, which equates to: £0.20 for a 1-minute screening, £2 for the 10-minute intake survey (plus £5 for linking at least one account with recent data), £0.80 for each 4-minute daily survey, and £2 for each 10-minute biweekly survey. Participants received £10 bonus payments for completing at least 24 out of 30 daily surveys and/or 5 out of 6 biweekly surveys.\n\n\n# Dataset\n\n## Digital Trace Data\n\nAs described above, we collected video game play data from five platforms: Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, iOS, and Android (full details in @tbl-platforms). To recap, on Xbox and Nintendo, we have *session-level* data, characterized by the following fields: a game ID (Xbox) or title (Nintendo), a start and end time, and genre(s). On Steam we have *hourly aggregates* - every hour, how much time people spent playing for all games they played in that hour. On iOS and Android, we have *daily aggregates* - every day, how much time people spent playing each game. We describe each platform in more detail below. For concision, we do not repeat the details of @tbl-platforms in here, but direct readers to that table or our supplementary materials for the exact variables in each platform's trace data.\n\nAll telemetry timestamps are stored as UTC, but can be converted to the participant's local time using the `local_timezone` variable.\n\nIn @fig-heatmap, we visualize the distribution of play across days and times. As expected, we find that the likelihood of play peaks on weekends from 8-11pm, and is lowest in the early morning.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diurnal play across Xbox, Nintendo, Steam.](index_files/figure-typst/fig-heatmap-1.svg){#fig-heatmap fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Self-reported Gaming\n\nWe also collected self-reported gaming data in each biweekly survey. Participants estimated the time they spent playing games on platforms they had linked during the study (e.g., excluding other platforms such as Playstation) in each of the following periods: last 24 hours, last 7 days, and last 14 days. In addition, participants reported details of at least 1 and up to 3 of their most recent gaming sessions (game, date, and start/end time).\n\n@fig-paired-dotplot compares the average self-reported distribution of play across platforms to the distribution in our digital trace data capture. It is vital to note that the self-report data not be treated as ground truth: we have good evidence that people's self-reports of media use are inaccurate [@KahnEtAl2014why; @ParryEtAl2021systematic], with some previous work finding systemic overestimation of video game play [@JohannesEtAl2021Video]. Nonetheless, it is likely that some portion of players' true gaming is systematically uncaptured, due to factors such as  missing titles (e.g., Nintendo third party), or player privacy settings (e.g., playing in invisible mode; setting certain games to private on Steam). The figure therefore provides a useful overview of the relative coverage of different platforms in our telemetry data.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average weekly playtime (minutes) by platform, self-reported vs telemetry (among users with telemetry).

We briefly describe which constructs we collected here; for further details of the specific measures and example items, see @tbl-measures.\n\n*Trait / traitlike (baseline).* We assessed chronotype, Big 5 personality, player trait typology, and gaming disorder symptoms at baseline. Gaming disorder symptoms were measured twice, at biweekly waves 1 and 6.\n\n*Daily.* Daily surveys captured: basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration in life in general; basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration in the context of video games; life satisfaction; affective valence; sleep quality; stressors; types of social gaming engaged; and self-reported displacement.\n\n*Biweekly.* Every two weeks we assessed: general mental wellbeing; depression symptoms; life satisfaction; basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration – video games; and subjective displacement.\n\n*Monthly (alternating biweekly).* On alternating biweekly surveys (i.e., monthly), we assessed: sleep quality; daytime sleepiness; and perceived harms and benefits of gaming.\n\n@fig-case-study illustrates the temporal dynamics of gaming behavior and mental wellbeing through three representative case studies.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sample of daily gaming patterns and mental wellbeing for three representative participants.

Although the original Squared tasks consist of the Simon, Stroop, and Flanker Squared, due to limited participation time we chose to only use the Simon Squared task as it had the greatest factor loading on attention control in the original study [@burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023].\n\nThe Simon Squared task is a short and validated measure of attention control that follows the standard Simon task [@simonAuditorySRCompatibility1967] but is completed in about three minutes. Participants see a target arrow pointing either left or right, with response labels \"LEFT\" and \"RIGHT\" printed underneath. Participants then must select the response option (e.g. \"LEFT\") that matches the arrow's direction (e.g. ◀︎). However, the arrow and response options can appear on either side of the screen, and participants must ignore this spatial configuration and attend only to the symbols' meanings.\n\nAfter reading the instructions, participants practice for 30 seconds with auditory and text feedback for response accuracy. They then see their score from the practice trials, review the instructions again, and are given 90 seconds to gain as many points as possible. Participants gain one point for each correct response, and lose one point for each incorrect response. After the 90 seconds, the number of correct responses minus the number of incorrect responses is the participant's task score. For a complete task description, see @burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023 and Figure 6 therein.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nOverall, 1077\\, 991\\, and 800 participants completed the Simon task at panel waves 1, 3, and 5. The average performances were approximately 10 points lower than in the in-person study of @burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023 (Figure 16). Participants on mobile devices generally attained lower scores than those not on mobile devices (@fig-simon, rows), but performance was generally stable across the three waves (@fig-simon, columns).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms of participants' Simon Squared task scores across study waves.

In each daily and biweekly survey, one item from the BANGS (daily) and BPNSFS (biweekly) was duplicated to assess response consistency [@MeadeCraig2012identifying]; participants whose responses to the two identical items differed by more than one scale point were flagged for potential careless responding.\n2.  In the telemetry, we use several heuristics to identify potential unreliable sessions: sessions beginning or ending in the future (indicative of clock manipulation or other errors), sessions longer than 12 hours long, 3 or more games being played simultaneously [TODO: other heuristics]\n3.  In the time use, we flag any cases with fewer than 5 distinct activities logged in a day, or that are missing any\n\n## Missingness\n\nAs with most longitudinal studies, attrition and missing data present important challenges for data quality and statistical inference. @tbl-missingness presents a comprehensive overview of missingness patterns across all data sources in our study, broken down by region (US and UK) and data type (Survey, Telemetry, and Cognitive Task).\n\nThe unit of observation differs across data types. For surveys and cognitive tasks, the unit is a completed survey or task. For telemetry, the unit varies by platform: Xbox and Nintendo use binary account linking, with data coverage considered maximal once linked (data provided directly by platform holders); Steam is measured hourly, with observations representing whether the participant's profile was publicly visible in each hour; iOS and Android are measured daily, with observations representing whether a valid screenshot was submitted covering that day's gaming.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {#tbl-missingness .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Missingness patterns across survey, telemetry, and cognitive task data by region. The table shows the number of participants (N), total expected observations, observations actually collected, missing observations, median number of missing observations per participant, and percentage of data completeness for each measure.

field.\n\nSome of these questions will be addressed in forthcoming registered reports: specifically, we have plans to test (1) key hypotheses from the Basic Needs in Games model [@BallouDeterding2024Basic] about how gaming relates to basic psychological needs over time, (2) the relationship between late-night gaming and sleep, and (3) the relationship between playtime in different genres and wellbeing.\n\nNonetheless, the richness of this data means that researchers can explore numerous other questions (or, indeed, conduct and compare alternative analysis approaches to the above questions). To stimulate ideas, we present a few questions we think the data are well-suited to answering.\n\n*How do seasons and weather impact playtime?* Because we capture time-stamped play sessions alongside participants’ geographic locations, researchers can merge in high‐resolution weather and daylight data to examine how environmental factors causally influence gaming behavior. Causal inference techniques such as inverse probability weighting can enable precise estimates of how, when, and how much people play in response to seasonal and meteorological changes. By quantifying these effects, researchers can better distinguish weather‐related demand from other drivers (like work schedules or weekend routines), improving the precision of studies on gaming’s impact on wellbeing, motivation, and cognition.\n\n*How do neurotypical and neurodiverse players differ in their gaming behavior?* Using the neurodivergence data we collected (which includes, for example, 360 participants who identify as having autism and 498 who identify as having ADHD), researchers can. Neurodiversity in games has regularly been studied in the context of specific games and with qualitative methods\n\nAccuracy of self-reported data - inference from other papers\n\nWe encourage researchers from a wide range of disciplines to explore these or other questions using the data we present, which is freely available for reuse under a CC0 license.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile this dataset represents a substantial step forward in holistic coverage of video game play, it remains imperfect: we did not capture data on PlayStation (\\~19% of gaming market) or computer games played outside the Steam platform (\\~11% of gaming market); on Nintendo, we do not have access to third-party titles (42% of Nintendo play), and our coverage of smartphone play is limited by the difficulties and inconsistencies of screenshot-based donation and OCR retrieval.\n\nWe further are unable to identify idle time (when players have a game open but are not actively playing it) and account sharing (when players let friends or family use their account); some playtime values may therefore be overestimates of the person's true playtime, though we are unable to say by how much.\n\n## Future Work\n\nThe trace data presented here is broad in scope but limited in granularity: we capture all gaming activity on a given platform, but not what happens within individual games. Prior work and theory make clear that in-game behaviors (e.g., what role a player adopts, whether they compete or cooperate, or how they perform in competitive modes) are critical determinants of player experience and thereby wellbeing (see e.g., @ElsonEtAl2014More for a review of how in-game contexts shape effects). This highlights a fundamental trade-off in digital trace research between breadth—how comprehensively play can be captured across platforms—and depth—the granularity of in-game behaviors and experiences. At present, our dataset emphasizes breadth, but we see strong potential in future study designs that combine platform-level telemetry with targeted in-game behavioral data to provide a more complete picture.\n\nWe also see strong potential in combining digital trace data with experimental designs that enable stronger causal inference—for example, randomizing players to single-player games only, or restricting play to certain times of day, to examine effects on social wellbeing or sleep. Previous researchers have noted a dearth of digital trace data-backed field experiments, while highlighting their potential [@StierEtAl2020Integrating]: Trace data not only captures naturalistic gaming behavior but also allows researchers to assess *substitution* (what games or platforms participants switch to under intervention) and *adherence* (how closely they follow assigned play patterns).\n\n## Data Availability\n\nAll data, materials, and code related to the dataset and this manuscript are available under {{< meta data-license >}} at {{< meta data-url >}}.\n\n# References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n```{=typst}\n#show: appendix.with()\n```\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Deviations from Preregistration\n\nWe made several deviations from our preregistration to ensure we could recruit enough high-quality participants to meet our sample size goals.
