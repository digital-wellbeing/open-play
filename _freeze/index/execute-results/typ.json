We present a dataset of 1\\.9K individuals' video game play telemetry data from Nintendo Switch, Steam, and Xbox, paired with psychological assessments across multiple dimensions of mental health, motivations, well-being, and cognitive ability. The data were collected over 12 weeks that included thirty daily assessments, six biweekly surveys, three biweekly cognitive tests, and play telemetry for 43 months. The data include 1\\.4M hours of video game play across 9\\,762 titles, 23K responses to 14 survey instruments, and 2\\.9K attention ability measures to facilitate examining longitudinal associations between play behaviors and psychological functioning. Data and codebook are available under a {{< meta data-license >}} license at {{< meta data-url >}}.\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\nDigital trace data---behavioral logs automatically collected by digital devices and online platforms---are necessary to better understand technology use and its psychological and health effects [@BurgessEtAl2024Potential; @Freelon2014Interpretation; @GriffioenEtAl2020improveda]. Self-reports of technology use do not accurately reflect objective technology use [@ParryEtAl2021systematic; @sewallRoleDepressionDiscrepancy2021], and are unsuitable for examining many phenomena of interest, such as seasonal patterns over long temporal horizons; high-frequency behavioral analysis at the level of hours, minutes, or even seconds; historical content analysis; and others due to limited accuracy and temporal resolution. Moreover, when technology use's relations to psychological survey instruments are of interest, digital trace data removes the possibility of common methods bias.\n\nTo combat these issues, digital trace data is increasingly used in studies on the psychological effects of smartphone and social media [e.g. @sewallDoesObjectivelyMeasured2022; @SiebersEtAl2024Adolescents; @YapEtAl2024Digital]. But despite the rapid growth of research using trace data from social media and smartphones, comparable efforts in video games remain rare. This absence is notable given that games constitute one of the most popular and psychologically rich forms of digital media, engaging billions of players worldwide across diverse genres, platforms, and social contexts [@Kaye2019Gaming; @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024, @Ofcom2023Online]. As a result, our understanding of video game play is often limited to narrow slices of behavior---single titles, single platforms, or small samples--leaving open questions about how gaming affects and interacts with people’s everyday lives.\n\nExisting use of trace data in video games typically takes the form of either game analytics research, often conducted in collaboration with industry at the level of an individual game, typically focused on industry-relevant behavioral rather than harms and benefits; or narrow-scope investigations into play and health within a single game or gaming platform (e.g., Xbox). Each of these approaches has limitations that constrain their utility for understanding gaming behavior in the wild.\n\nGame analytics research has made substantial contributions to understanding player behavior, engagement, and game design processes [@SifaEtAl2021LargeScale; @ElsonEtAl2014More]. However, these studies are often conducted within commercial partners using proprietary data that are not publicly shared [@KahnEtAl2014why; @LiuEtAl2024Connecting], which limits transparency, reproducibility, and opportunities for independent reanalysis. Moreover, because their objectives often center on optimizing player experience, design, or monetization rather than examining psychological or health outcomes [e.g., @RattingerEtAl2016Integrating; @CanossaEtAl2019influencers], findings may not speak directly to questions of wellbeing. In other cases, game analytics is conducted on fully anonymized data wherein researchers have access to detailed behavioral logs but little information about who the players are or survey data that could provide indicators of mental health and motivation [@ZendleEtAl2023Crosscultural; @VuorreEtAl2021largescale].\n\nTrace data research into games and wellbeing comprises a much smaller part of the literature with its own set of key limitations. Where trace data has been used in video games studies, it has largely been limited to a few games [@VuorreEtAl2022Time; @JohannesEtAl2021Video; @LarrieuEtAl2023How; @PerryEtAl2018onlineonly; @LiuEtAl2024Connecting] or single platform [@BallouEtAl2024Registered; @BallouEtAl2025Perceived]. However, players commonly play many games on multiple platforms. This fragmentation obscures a key part of real-world behavior: players’ shifting engagement patterns across consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. \n\nA multi-platform approach enables (1) more diverse samples by allowing researchers to recruit from more than one gaming platform whose players differ in both gaming engagement and wider demographics [@VahloEtAl2017Digital; @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024], and (2) more comprehensive and ecologically valid investigations of how and when people play, whether different platforms substitute or complement one another, and how these choices relate to daily routines or broader temporal rhythms (e.g., weekends, seasons, or daylight variation). \n\nTaken together, these considerations underscore the urgent need for comprehensive (i.e., multi-platform) and transparent data to advance the scientific study of video game play. The dataset presented here directly addresses this need by combining longitudinal telemetry from multiple gaming platforms with rich psychological and cognitive measures collected under preregistered, ethically approved conditions. We leverage both industry-facilitated data access from major gaming platforms and open-source, participant-driven tools [@KingPersily2020New; @Xiao2023Debate] to achieve unprecedented coverage of naturalistic play. By making these data openly available, we aim to provide a foundation for cumulative, methodologically rigorous, and theory-driven research on digital play and its role in everyday life.\n\nHere, we present a longitudinal dataset of digital trace data across multiple gaming platforms consisting of 1.9K participants, 15.7K daily surveys, 6.8K surveys, and a total of 1.4M of gameplay distributed across 1.5M. Digital trace data was sourced for five platforms---Xbox, Nintendo, Steam, iOS, and Android---through distinct pipelines detailed below. The data collection methods were preregistered as part of a Stage 1 registered report (<https://osf.io/pb5nu>).\n\nThe dataset is openly available under a {{< meta data-license >}} license at {{< meta data-url >}} for unrestricted reuse. @tbl-overview shows a high-level overview of the dataset.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {#tbl-overview .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Overview of the dataset and sources.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure: set block(breakable: true)\n\n#block[ // start block\n\n  #let style-dict = (\n    // tinytable style-dict after\n    \"0_0\": 0, \"1_0\": 0, \"2_0\": 0, \"3_0\": 0, \"4_0\": 0, \"5_0\": 0, \"6_0\": 0, \"7_0\": 0, \"8_0\": 0, \"0_1\": 0, \"1_1\": 0, \"2_1\": 0, \"3_1\": 0, \"4_1\": 0, \"5_1\": 0, \"6_1\": 0, \"7_1\": 0, \"8_1\": 0, \"0_2\": 0, \"1_2\": 0, \"2_2\": 0, \"3_2\": 0, \"4_2\": 0, \"5_2\": 0, \"6_2\": 0, \"7_2\": 0, \"8_2\": 0, \"0_3\": 0, \"1_3\": 0, \"2_3\": 0, \"3_3\": 0, \"4_3\": 0, \"5_3\": 0, \"6_3\": 0, \"7_3\": 0, \"8_3\": 0, \"0_4\": 0, \"1_4\": 0, \"2_4\": 0, \"3_4\": 0, \"4_4\": 0, \"5_4\": 0, \"6_4\": 0, \"7_4\": 0, \"8_4\": 0, \"0_5\": 0, \"1_5\": 0, \"2_5\": 0, \"3_5\": 0, \"4_5\": 0, \"5_5\": 0, \"6_5\": 0, \"7_5\": 0, \"8_5\": 0, \"0_6\": 0, \"1_6\": 0, \"2_6\": 0, \"3_6\": 0, \"4_6\": 0, \"5_6\": 0, \"6_6\": 0, \"7_6\": 0, \"8_6\": 0\n  )\n\n  #let style-array = ( \n    // tinytable cell style after\n    (fontsize: 0.7em,),\n  )\n\n  // Helper function to get cell style\n  #let get-style(x, y) = {\n    let key = str(y) + \"_\" + str(x)\n    if key in style-dict { style-array.at(style-dict.at(key)) } else { none }\n  }\n\n  // tinytable align-default-array before\n  #let align-default-array = ( left, left, left, left, left, left, left, ) // tinytable align-default-array here\n  #show table.cell: it => {\n    if style-array.len() == 0 { return it }\n    \n    let style = get-style(it.x, it.y)\n    if style == none { return it }\n    \n    let tmp = it\n    if (\"fontsize\" in style) { tmp = text(size: style.fontsize, tmp) }\n    if (\"color\" in style) { tmp = text(fill: style.color, tmp) }\n    if (\"indent\" in style) { tmp = pad(left: style.indent, tmp) }\n    if (\"underline\" in style) { tmp = underline(tmp) }\n    if (\"italic\" in style) { tmp = emph(tmp) }\n    if (\"bold\" in style) { tmp = strong(tmp) }\n    if (\"mono\" in style) { tmp = math.mono(tmp) }\n    if (\"strikeout\" in style) { tmp = strike(tmp) }\n    if (\"smallcaps\" in style) { tmp = smallcaps(tmp) }\n    tmp\n  }\n\n  #align(center, [\n\n  #table( // tinytable table start\n    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto, auto, auto, auto),\n    stroke: none,\n    rows: auto,\n    align: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"align\" in style { style.align } else { left }\n    },\n    fill: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"background\" in style { style.background }\n    },\n table.hline(y: 1, start: 0, end: 7, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 9, start: 0, end: 7, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n table.hline(y: 0, start: 0, end: 7, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n    // tinytable lines before\n\n    // tinytable header start\n    table.header(\n      repeat: true,\n[Data type], [N survey\nsubj.], [N users w/ trace data], [Events], [Hours], [Median events / user], [Median active days],\n    ),\n    // tinytable header end\n\n    // tinytable cell content after\n[Intake survey], [34,643], [ ], [35K], [ ], [1.0], [1],\n[Daily surveys], [1,185], [ ], [16K], [ ], [11.0], [13],\n[Biweekly surveys], [1,948], [ ], [7K], [ ], [4.0], [4],\n[Steam], [1,526], [2879], [356K], [291.0K], [108.0], [54],\n[Nintendo], [553], [1586], [145K], [101.8K], [94.0], [57],\n[Xbox], [175], [330], [375K], [460.3K], [1.4K], [699],\n[iOS], [95], [95], [4K], [3.4K], [28.0], [27],\n[Android], [77], [77], [3K], [2.5K], [21.0], [21],\n\n    // tinytable footer after\n\n  ) // end table\n\n  ]) // end align\n\n] // end block\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n# Method\n\n## Design\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Participant flow during study intake.](index_files/figure-typst/fig-sankey-1.svg){#fig-sankey fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nThe study consisted of four stages (@fig-sankey).\n\n### Stage 1: Screening\n\nIn the first stage, we screened participants in order to find people aged 18-40 who (1) self-report playing video games, (2) self-report that at least 50% of their total video game play takes place on the platforms included in the study, and (3) were willing to link their gaming accounts to provide digital trace data. We screened participants from two panel sources: PureProfile and Prolific.\n\nParticipants were recruited under an initial set of ethnicity‐based quotas designed to mirror the general population’s demographic composition. After we reached approximately 50% of our target sample under quota constraints and found that further quota‐eligible recruits were scarce, we suspended the quotas for the remainder of data collection; all subsequent participants were enrolled on a first‐come, first‐served basis. Final sample characteristic reflect both quota‐driven and open‐enrollment phases (see below).\n\n### Stage 2: Account Linking\n\nParticipants who were deemed eligible during screening proceeded directly to an account linking survey wherein they provided details of the gaming platforms they actively use. For UK participants, this includes Nintendo Switch, Steam, Android and iOS. For US participants, this includes the same four alongside Xbox. Details of how participants linked each type of account are shown in @tbl-platforms.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-platforms .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Platform Details'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure: set block(breakable: true)\n\n#block[ // start block\n\n  #let style-dict = (\n    // tinytable style-dict after\n    \"0_0\": 0, \"1_0\": 0, \"2_0\": 0, \"3_0\": 0, \"4_0\": 0, \"5_0\": 0, \"0_1\": 0, \"1_1\": 0, \"2_1\": 0, \"3_1\": 0, \"4_1\": 0, \"5_1\": 0, \"0_2\": 0, \"1_2\": 0, \"2_2\": 0, \"3_2\": 0, \"4_2\": 0, \"5_2\": 0, \"0_3\": 0, \"1_3\": 0, \"2_3\": 0, \"3_3\": 0, \"4_3\": 0, \"5_3\": 0\n  )\n\n  #let style-array = ( \n    // tinytable cell style after\n    (fontsize: 0.7em,),\n  )\n\n  // Helper function to get cell style\n  #let get-style(x, y) = {\n    let key = str(y) + \"_\" + str(x)\n    if key in style-dict { style-array.at(style-dict.at(key)) } else { none }\n  }\n\n  // tinytable align-default-array before\n  #let align-default-array = ( left, left, left, left, ) // tinytable align-default-array here\n  #show table.cell: it => {\n    if style-array.len() == 0 { return it }\n    \n    let style = get-style(it.x, it.y)\n    if style == none { return it }\n    \n    let tmp = it\n    if (\"fontsize\" in style) { tmp = text(size: style.fontsize, tmp) }\n    if (\"color\" in style) { tmp = text(fill: style.color, tmp) }\n    if (\"indent\" in style) { tmp = pad(left: style.indent, tmp) }\n    if (\"underline\" in style) { tmp = underline(tmp) }\n    if (\"italic\" in style) { tmp = emph(tmp) }\n    if (\"bold\" in style) { tmp = strong(tmp) }\n    if (\"mono\" in style) { tmp = math.mono(tmp) }\n    if (\"strikeout\" in style) { tmp = strike(tmp) }\n    if (\"smallcaps\" in style) { tmp = smallcaps(tmp) }\n    tmp\n  }\n\n  #align(center, [\n\n  #table( // tinytable table start\n    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto),\n    stroke: none,\n    rows: auto,\n    align: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"align\" in style { style.align } else { left }\n    },\n    fill: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"background\" in style { style.background }\n    },\n table.hline(y: 1, start: 0, end: 4, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 6, start: 0, end: 4, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n table.hline(y: 0, start: 0, end: 4, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n    // tinytable lines before\n\n    // tinytable header start\n    table.header(\n      repeat: true,\n[Platform], [Data Source], [Account Linking Process], [Type of Data Collected],\n    ),\n    // tinytable header end\n\n    // tinytable cell content after\n[Nintendo], [Data\\-sharing agreements with Nintendo of America (US) and Nintendo of Europe (UK)], [Participants share an identifier contained within a QR code on Nintendo web interface.

Biweekly survey links were sent every second week from the first day of the study at 12pm and remained available for 96 hours.\n\n## Participants\n\n::: {.place arguments='auto, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {#tbl-demographics .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Sample demographics for qualified participants with general-population benchmarks (where available).'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure: set block(breakable: true)\n\n#block[ // start block\n\n  #let style-dict = (\n    // tinytable style-dict after\n    \"0_0\": 0, \"1_0\": 0, \"2_0\": 0, \"3_0\": 0, \"4_0\": 0, \"5_0\": 0, \"6_0\": 0, \"7_0\": 0, \"8_0\": 0, \"9_0\": 0, \"10_0\": 0, \"11_0\": 0, \"12_0\": 0, \"13_0\": 0, \"0_1\": 0, \"1_1\": 0, \"2_1\": 0, \"3_1\": 0, \"4_1\": 0, \"5_1\": 0, \"6_1\": 0, \"7_1\": 0, \"8_1\": 0, \"9_1\": 0, \"10_1\": 0, \"11_1\": 0, \"12_1\": 0, \"13_1\": 0, \"0_2\": 0, \"1_2\": 0, \"2_2\": 0, \"3_2\": 0, \"4_2\": 0, \"5_2\": 0, \"6_2\": 0, \"7_2\": 0, \"8_2\": 0, \"9_2\": 0, \"10_2\": 0, \"11_2\": 0, \"12_2\": 0, \"13_2\": 0, \"0_3\": 0, \"1_3\": 0, \"2_3\": 0, \"3_3\": 0, \"4_3\": 0, \"5_3\": 0, \"6_3\": 0, \"7_3\": 0, \"8_3\": 0, \"9_3\": 0, \"10_3\": 0, \"11_3\": 0, \"12_3\": 0, \"13_3\": 0, \"0_4\": 0, \"1_4\": 0, \"2_4\": 0, \"3_4\": 0, \"4_4\": 0, \"5_4\": 0, \"6_4\": 0, \"7_4\": 0, \"8_4\": 0, \"9_4\": 0, \"10_4\": 0, \"11_4\": 0, \"12_4\": 0, \"13_4\": 0, \"0_5\": 0, \"1_5\": 0, \"2_5\": 0, \"3_5\": 0, \"4_5\": 0, \"5_5\": 0, \"6_5\": 0, \"7_5\": 0, \"8_5\": 0, \"9_5\": 0, \"10_5\": 0, \"11_5\": 0, \"12_5\": 0, \"13_5\": 0\n  )\n\n  #let style-array = ( \n    // tinytable cell style after\n    (fontsize: 0.7em,),\n  )\n\n  // Helper function to get cell style\n  #let get-style(x, y) = {\n    let key = str(y) + \"_\" + str(x)\n    if key in style-dict { style-array.at(style-dict.at(key)) } else { none }\n  }\n\n  // tinytable align-default-array before\n  #let align-default-array = ( left, left, left, left, left, left, ) // tinytable align-default-array here\n  #show table.cell: it => {\n    if style-array.len() == 0 { return it }\n    \n    let style = get-style(it.x, it.y)\n    if style == none { return it }\n    \n    let tmp = it\n    if (\"fontsize\" in style) { tmp = text(size: style.fontsize, tmp) }\n    if (\"color\" in style) { tmp = text(fill: style.color, tmp) }\n    if (\"indent\" in style) { tmp = pad(left: style.indent, tmp) }\n    if (\"underline\" in style) { tmp = underline(tmp) }\n    if (\"italic\" in style) { tmp = emph(tmp) }\n    if (\"bold\" in style) { tmp = strong(tmp) }\n    if (\"mono\" in style) { tmp = math.mono(tmp) }\n    if (\"strikeout\" in style) { tmp = strike(tmp) }\n    if (\"smallcaps\" in style) { tmp = smallcaps(tmp) }\n    tmp\n  }\n\n  #align(center, [\n\n  #table( // tinytable table start\n    columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto, auto, auto),\n    stroke: none,\n    rows: auto,\n    align: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"align\" in style { style.align } else { left }\n    },\n    fill: (x, y) => {\n      let style = get-style(x, y)\n      if style != none and \"background\" in style { style.background }\n    },\n table.hline(y: 1, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.05em + black),\n table.hline(y: 14, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n table.hline(y: 0, start: 0, end: 6, stroke: 0.1em + black),\n    // tinytable lines before\n\n    // tinytable header start\n    table.header(\n      repeat: true,\n[Variable], [Level], [US Sample %], [US Gen Pop %], [UK Sample %], [UK Gen Pop %],\n    ),\n    // tinytable header end\n\n    // tinytable cell content after\n[Gender], [Man], [64.1], [49], [71], [49.6],\n[Gender], [Woman], [28.8], [48.9], [24], [49.5],\n[Gender], [Other gender identity], [7.2], [2.1], [5], [0.9],\n[Ethnicity], [White], [63.3], [75.5], [84.8], [81.7],\n[Ethnicity], [Asian], [8.8], [6.3], [7.9], [9.3],\n[Ethnicity], [Two or More Races], [13.9], [3], [4.5], [2.9],\n[Ethnicity], [Black], [9.3], [13.6], [1.9], [4],\n[Ethnicity], [Other], [3.9], [0], [0.8], [2.1],\n[Ethnicity], [American Indian and Alaska Native], [0.7], [1.3], [0], [0],\n[Ethnicity], [Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander], [0.2], [0.3], [0], [0],\n[Education], [Completed secondary or less], [59.7], [61], [48.7], [60.1],\n[Education], [Bachelor's degree], [32.9], [24], [35.3], [25.5],\n[Education], [Postgraduate], [7.3], [15], [16], [14.4],\n\n    // tinytable footer after\n\n  ) // end table\n\n  ]) // end align\n\n] // end block\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nOur final sample consists of 2099 qualified participants, selected from a pool of 34643 screened participants. Of the 2099 with recent telemetry, 1948 also completed at least one survey. On average, participants were. Due to errors in screening, four participants over the age of 40 were included.\n\n@tbl-demographics shows demographic characteristics of the final sample alongside general population benchmarks. Our participants are more likely to be male, non-binary, and bi- or multiracial than the general population. Although the demographics of the population of people who play video games are less well understood, our sample's demographics are broadly consistent with previously reported data [e.g., @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024].\n\nBesides those appearing in @tbl-demographics, we collected various other demographic variables from eligible participants at intake, including employment status, height and weight, self-identified and diagnosed neurodivergence (e.g., ASD, ADHD, dyslexia), political party affiliation, marital status, caretaking responsibilities, and postal geography (general area only; first three digits of the five-digit US ZIP Code; UK outward code). Further details of these are available in the online codebook.\n\n## Ethics and Compensation\n\nThis study received ethical approval from the Social Sciences and Humanities Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (OII_CIA_23_107). All participants provided informed consent at the start of the study, including consent to their data being shared openly for reanalysis.\n\nThe data released here is pseudonymized for participant privacy. However, we recognize that the possibility of reidentification cannot be ruled out due to the detailed demographics present in the dataset alongside the digital trace data. With careful consideration of the risks [e.g., @ShawEtAl2025DECIDE], we elect to share the full data, owing to several factors: (1) participants were thoroughly briefed on the procedure and directly consented to their data being pseudonymously shared; (2) for sensitive items (e.g., political affiliation), participants could select \"prefer not to share\"; (3) evidence suggests even datasets with less participant information may be reidentifiable based on trace data alone [@SekaraEtAl2021Temporal]; (4) data-sharing agreements with Nintendo and Microsoft specifically prohibit the companies themselves from connecting our survey data back to their telemetry; (5) the harms associated with reidentification are moderate, and (6) the research community has a strong interest in open data for reproducibility and cumulative science. \n\nTo balance openness with ethical responsibility, the dataset is released under a modified CC0 1.0 Universal license that retains full reuse rights but includes an additional No-Reidentification Clause, requiring users to follow standard research ethics and prohibiting any attempt to reidentify participants.\n\nProlific participants were paid at a rate of £12/hour for all study components, which equates to: £0.20 for a 1-minute screening, £2 for the 10-minute intake survey (plus £5 for linking at least one account with recent data), £0.80 for each 4-minute daily survey, and £2 for each 10-minute biweekly survey. Participants received £10 bonus payments for completing at least 24 out of 30 daily surveys and/or 5 out of 6 biweekly surveys.\n\n\n# Dataset\n\n## Digital Trace Data\n\nAs described above, we collected video game play data from five platforms: Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, iOS, and Android (full details in @tbl-platforms). To recap, on Xbox and Nintendo, we have *session-level* data, characterized by the following fields: a game ID (Xbox) or title (Nintendo), a start and end time, and genre(s). On Steam we have *hourly game-level aggregates* - every hour, how much time people spent playing each games they played that hour. On iOS and Android, we have *daily aggregates* - every day, how much time people spent playing games as a whole. We describe each platform in more detail below. For concision, we do not repeat the details of @tbl-platforms here, but direct readers to that table or our supplementary materials for the exact variables in each platform's trace data.\n\nTo prepare the data, we first merged adjacent sessions of the same game, removed sessions of under 1 minute (reflective of artifacts such as turning on a console that had been previously paused in-game before immediately switching to a new game) and those that took place in non-games (e.g., streaming services or storefronts). These preprocessing steps resulted in the joining or removal of 56.6% of Nintendo rows, and 87.3% of Xbox rows---the vast majority of which were under 5 minutes. Orphaned and non-game sessions are not present on other platforms. We then further filtered suspicious sessions or days (see Data Quality below).\n\nIn @fig-heatmap, we visualize the distribution of play across days and times. As expected, we find that the likelihood of play peaks on weekends from 8-11pm local time for each participant, and is lowest in the early morning. \n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diurnal play across Xbox, Nintendo, Steam.](index_files/figure-typst/fig-heatmap-1.svg){#fig-heatmap fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Self-reported Gaming\n\nWe also collected self-reported gaming data in each biweekly survey. Participants estimated the time they spent playing games on platforms they had linked during the study (e.g., excluding other platforms such as Playstation) in each of the following periods: last 24 hours, last 7 days, and last 14 days. In addition, participants reported details of at least 1 and up to 3 of their most recent gaming sessions (game, date, and start/end time).\n\n@fig-paired-dotplot compares the average self-reported distribution of play across platforms to the distribution in our digital trace data capture. It is vital to note that the self-report data not be treated as ground truth: we have good evidence that people's self-reports of media use are inaccurate [@KahnEtAl2014why; @ParryEtAl2021systematic], with some previous work finding systemic overestimation of video game play [@JohannesEtAl2021Video]. Nonetheless, it is likely that some portion of players' true gaming is systematically uncaptured, due to factors such as  missing titles (e.g., Nintendo third party), or player privacy settings (e.g., playing in invisible mode; setting certain games to private on Steam). The figure therefore provides a useful overview of the relative coverage of different platforms in our telemetry data.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average weekly playtime (minutes) by platform, self-reported vs telemetry (among users with telemetry).

We briefly describe which constructs we collected here; for further details of the specific measures and example items, see @tbl-measures.\n\nTo prepare daily and biweekly survey data, we removed duplicate entries from within the same survey wave and those that had errors in the coding of waves (e.g., administration of survey wave 31 due to technical issues), in total comprising 9.7% of daily surveys, 2.2% of biweekly surveys. We further removed rows including failed attention checks (see Data Quality below), comprising 4.7% of daily surveys and 0.5% of biweekly surveys. After cleaning, the final survey dataset includes 15,734 daily surveys and 6,844 biweekly surveys.\n\n*Trait / traitlike (baseline).* We assessed chronotype, Big 5 personality, player trait typology, and gaming disorder symptoms at baseline. Gaming disorder symptoms were measured twice, at biweekly waves 1 and 6.\n\n*Daily.* Daily surveys captured: basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration in life in general; basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration in the context of video games; life satisfaction; affective valence; sleep quality; stressors; types of social gaming engaged; and self-reported displacement.\n\n*Biweekly.* Every two weeks we assessed: general mental wellbeing; depression symptoms; life satisfaction; basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration – video games; and subjective displacement.\n\n*Monthly (alternating biweekly).* On alternating biweekly surveys (i.e., monthly), we assessed: sleep quality; daytime sleepiness; and perceived harms and benefits of gaming.\n\n@fig-case-study illustrates the temporal dynamics of gaming behavior and mental wellbeing through three representative case studies.\n\n::: {.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sample of daily gaming patterns and mental wellbeing for three representative participants.

Although the original Squared tasks consist of the Simon, Stroop, and Flanker Squared, due to limited participation time we chose to only use the Simon Squared task as it had the greatest factor loading on attention control in the original study [@burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023].\n\nThe Simon Squared task is a short and validated measure of attention control that follows the standard Simon task [@simonAuditorySRCompatibility1967] but is completed in about three minutes. Participants see a target arrow pointing either left or right, with response labels \"LEFT\" and \"RIGHT\" printed underneath. Participants then must select the response option (e.g. \"LEFT\") that matches the arrow's direction (e.g. ◀︎). However, the arrow and response options can appear on either side of the screen, and participants must ignore this spatial configuration and attend only to the symbols' meanings.\n\nAfter reading the instructions, participants practice for 30 seconds with auditory and text feedback for response accuracy. They then see their score from the practice trials, review the instructions again, and are given 90 seconds to gain as many points as possible. Participants gain one point for each correct response, and lose one point for each incorrect response. After the 90 seconds, the number of correct responses minus the number of incorrect responses is the participant's task score. For a complete task description, see @burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023 and Figure 6 therein.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nOverall, 1076, 991, and 800 participants completed the Simon task at biweekly waves 1, 3, and 5. The average performances were approximately 10 points lower than in the in-person study of @burgoyneNatureMeasurementAttention2023 (Figure 16). Participants on mobile devices generally attained lower scores than those not on mobile devices (@fig-simon, rows), but performance was generally stable across the three waves (@fig-simon, columns).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms of participants' Simon Squared task scores across study waves.

Participants provided this information by placing activites based on their start and end time using a custom web app ([https://github.com/andreifoldes/o-timeusediary](https://github.com/andreifoldes/o-timeusediary)). Participants could select from 11 categories:: Education, Exercise and Sports, Household and Family Care, Offline Leisure & Social Life, Other Digital Media Use, Personal Care, Sleep, Travel and Transportation, Video Gaming, Work and Employment, and Other. The median number of distinct activities entered per day was 10. \n\n@fig-time-use presents an illustrative example of one participant's time use diary for a single day, alongside their gaming sessions recorded through telemetry and survey completion time.\n\n## Data Quality \n\nWhile not exhaustive, the data we share in clean implements a variety of data quality checks. Specifically, in each daily and biweekly survey, one item from the BANGS (daily) and BPNSFS (biweekly) was duplicated to assess response consistency [@MeadeCraig2012identifying]; participants whose responses to the two identical items differed by more than one scale point were flagged for potential careless responding (daily surveys: 4.7% flagged, biweekly: 0.5%).\n\nIn the telemetry, we use several heuristics to identify potential unreliable sessions: (a) sessions beginning or ending in the future (indicative of clock manipulation or other errors), (b) sessions longer than 10 hours (indicative of substantial idle time or background usage), (c) 3 or more games played simultaneously (indicative of inactivity on multiple games or data corruption). In total, we removed 0.1% of Xbox sessions, and 0.9% of Nintendo sessions based on these criteria.\n\n## Missingness\n\nAs with most longitudinal studies, attrition and missing data present important challenges for data quality and statistical inference. @tbl-missingness presents a comprehensive overview of missingness patterns across all data sources in our study, broken down by region (US and UK) and data type (Survey, Telemetry, and Cognitive Task).\n\nThe unit of observation differs across data types. For surveys and cognitive tasks, the unit is a completed survey or task.

Previous studies on games and health have typically used (1) self-report data with substantial limitations on accuracy, time range, and detail; (2) large-scale data that is either anonymized and not linkable to individuals or survey responses [@ZendleEtAl2023Crosscultural; @VuorreEtAl2021largescale] and/or focused on commercially-relevant game analytics topics [@RattingerEtAl2016Integrating; @CanossaEtAl2019influencers], and thus lacking good measures of ground truth for questions about player health; or (3) small-scale trace data from single platforms or games, providing only a small slice of overall gaming behaviour and thus limiting generalizability [@VuorreEtAl2022Time; @JohannesEtAl2021Video; @LarrieuEtAl2023How; @PerryEtAl2018onlineonly; @BallouEtAl2024Registered; @BallouEtAl2025Perceived].\n\n## Digital Trace Data Infrastructure\n\nThis dataset delivers on both calls for greater collaboration between the tech industry and academics [@KingPersily2020New; @LazerEtAl2020Computational], as well as simultaneous calls for better trace data access without direct industry involvement [@Xiao2023Debate; @ValkenburgEtAl2024It; @BoeschotenEtAl2023Port]. The data-sharing agreements with Nintendo of America, Nintendo of Europe, and Microsoft are the first of their kind, enabling researchers to access telemetry data from major gaming platforms while ensuring user privacy and data security. By making this dataset openly available under a CC0 license, we aim to catalyze further research in this area, allowing other researchers to explore the rich data we have collected.\n\nAt the same time, the Steam and smartphone data collection show the value of open trace data to study platforms that are less willing or able to participate actively. Several previous studies have collected smartphone data using screenshots, with some success in automating the extraction of these data [@ParrySewall2021How; @FeizEtAl2022Understanding; @LiuEtAl2024UserDonated]. Open trace data infrastructure remains an arms race, often relying on industry-provided APIs that can change or be deprecated at any time [@DavidsonEtAl2023Platformcontrolled; @BallouEtAl2023Four]. Nonetheless, we believe it is vital for researchers to advance both pathways for the best chance to understand the effects of technology.\n\n## Empirical Opportunities  \n\nWe believe this dataset has potential to address a wide variety of pertinent research questions for the field. Some of these questions will be addressed in forthcoming registered reports: specifically, we have plans to test (1) key hypotheses from the Basic Needs in Games model [@BallouDeterding2024Basic] about how gaming relates to basic psychological needs over time, (2) the relationship between late-night gaming and sleep, and (3) the relationship between playtime in different genres and wellbeing.\n\nThe richness of this data means that researchers can explore numerous other questions (or, indeed, conduct and compare alternative analysis approaches to the above questions). To stimulate ideas, we present a few questions we think the data are well-suited to answering.\n\n*How do neurotypical and neurodiverse players differ in their gaming behavior?* Using the neurodivergence data we collected (which includes, for example, 361 participants who identify as having autism and 499 who identify as having ADHD), researchers can explore differences in the types of games, gaming experiences, and trajectory of play over time between neurotypical and neurodiverse players. Neurodiversity in games has regularly been studied in the context of specific games and with qualitative methods [@KilmerEtAl2023Therapeuticallya; @ZolyomiSchmalz2017Mining], with some researchers noting that research focuses on therapeutic interventions delivered through games to \"cure\" neurodivergent players of undesirable traits [@SpielGerling2021Purpose]. Research on neurodivergent players' naturalistic gaming behavior across platforms has to date received less attention. \n\n*How do seasons and weather impact playtime?* Because we capture time-stamped play sessions alongside participants’ geographic locations, researchers can merge in high‐resolution weather and daylight data to examine how environmental factors causally influence gaming behavior. Causal inference techniques such as inverse probability weighting can enable precise estimates of how, when, and how much people play in response to seasonal and meteorological changes. Quantifying these effects can better distinguish environmental factors driving video game play from other drivers (like work schedules or weekend routines) and improve our ability to predict regional changes to gaming behavior on a day-to-day basis [@Palomba2019Digital], or the behavioral impacts of climate change in the long term.\n\n*Does irregular, extended, or overnight play predict subsequent rises in problematic play, and can telemetry provide early warning signals?* Using the data we collected about displacement---the extent to which gaming supports or interferes with other areas of life---as well as about gaming disorder (at Waves 1 and 6), telemetry can provide insights into patterns of gaming that coincide or lead to subsequent changes in the degree of problematic play. Long-term, more accurately identifying the longitudinal behavioral correlates of maladaptive gaming---beyond simple heuristics such as the average amount of weekly play in the last 6 months---can help us create personalized models and early warning systems for players and parents. \n\nWe encourage researchers from a wide range of disciplines to explore these or other questions using the data we present, which is freely available for reuse under a CC0 license.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile this dataset represents a substantial step forward in holistic coverage of video game play, it remains imperfect: we did not capture data on PlayStation (\\~19% of gaming market) or computer games played outside the Steam platform (\\~11% of gaming market); on Nintendo, we do not have access to third-party titles (42% of Nintendo play, based on Nintendo-provided metrics for each player in our sample); and our coverage of smartphone play is limited by the onerous workflow limiting the response rate, and the difficulties of reliable OCR extraction.\n\nWe further are unable to identify idle time (when players have a game open but are not actively playing it) and account sharing (when players let friends or family use their account); some playtime values may therefore be overestimates of the person's true playtime, though we are unable to say by how much.\n\nFinally, while our sample is large, diverse, and reasonably well matched with national averages on certain demographic characteristics (e.g., ethnicity and education), is it unlikely to be representative either of the general population or the population of adults who play games. Selection effects are inherent to our study: not all players will be willing to share their gaming history and identifiable information with researchers, or to participate in an intensive battery of surveys. However, we are largely unable to quantify representativeness, as the (adult) gaming population is poorly understood in its own right. Although we have broad estimates of engagement among key demographic segments showing, for example, that men are more likely to play games [@Ofcom2023Online; @EntertainmentSoftwareAssociation20242024], digital trace data describing gaming in terms of amount, seasonality, specific titles and genres, or other factors remains lacking. In other words, we cannot say how representative our sample is of players in the US or UK, because we do not yet know what representative gaming behavior looks like [see e.g., @RehbeinEtAl2016Video]---or whether representativeness is even a meaningful aim [@Kaye2019Gaming].\n\n## Future Work\n\nThe trace data presented here is broad in scope but limited in granularity: we capture all gaming activity on a given platform, but not what happens within individual games. Prior work and theory make clear that in-game behaviors (e.g., what role a player adopts, whether they compete or cooperate, or how they perform in competitive modes) are critical determinants of player experience and thereby wellbeing (see e.g., @ElsonEtAl2014More for a review of how in-game contexts shape effects). This highlights a fundamental trade-off in digital trace research between breadth—how comprehensively play can be captured across platforms—and depth—the granularity of in-game behaviors and experiences. At present, our dataset emphasizes breadth, but we see strong potential in future study designs that combine platform-level telemetry with targeted in-game behavioral data to provide a more complete picture.\n\nWe also see strong potential in combining digital trace data with experimental designs that enable stronger causal inference—for example, randomizing players to single-player games only, or restricting play to certain times of day, to examine effects on social wellbeing or sleep. Previous researchers have noted a dearth of digital trace data-backed field experiments, while highlighting their potential [@StierEtAl2020Integrating]: Trace data not only captures naturalistic gaming behavior but also allows researchers to assess *substitution* (what games or platforms participants switch to under intervention) and *adherence* (how closely they follow assigned play patterns).\n\n## Data Availability\n\nAll data, materials, and code related to the dataset and this manuscript are available under {{< meta data-license >}} at {{< meta data-url >}}.\n\n# References\n\n:::: {#refs}\n::::\n\n```{=typst}\n#show: appendix.with()\n```\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Deviations from Preregistration\n\nWe made several deviations from our preregistration to ensure we could recruit enough high-quality participants to meet our sample size goals.
