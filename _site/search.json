    "text": "Digital trace data—behavioral logs automatically collected by digital devices and online platforms—are necessary to better understand technology use and its psychological and health effects (Burgess et al., 2024; Freelon, 2014; Griffioen et al., 2020). Self-reports of technology use do not accurately reflect objective technology use (Parry et al., 2021; Sewall & Parry, 2021), and are unsuitable for examining many phenomena of interest, such as seasonal patterns over long temporal horizons; high-frequency behavioral analysis at the level of hours, minutes, or even seconds; historical content analysis; and others due to limited accuracy and temporal resolution. Moreover, when technology use’s relations to psychological survey instruments are of interest, digital trace data removes the possibility of common methods bias.\nTo combat these issues, digital trace data is increasingly used in studies of smartphone and social media use (e.g. Sewall et al., 2022), but less so in studies of video game play—one of the world’s foremost leisure activities (Entertainment Software Association, 2024; Ofcom, 2023). Trace data in video games primarily falls under the field of game analytics or data science, but (1) the majority of these studies involve the use of proprietary data that is not publicly shared, and (2) the focus of this field tends to be more on player behavior metrics with clear industry value rather than academic inquiry for the common good.\nWhere trace data has been used in video games studies, it has largely been limited to a few games (Johannes et al., 2021; Larrieu et al., 2023; Perry et al., 2018; Vuorre et al., 2022) or single platform (Ballou et al., 2023, 2025). However, players commonly play many games on multiple platforms. Moreover, the scope of psychological attributes in these studies tends to be limited to e.g. a small set of well-being outcomes.\n\n\nHere, we present a longitudinal dataset of digital trace data across multiple gaming platforms consisting of 2.0K participants, 18.8K daily surveys, 7.0K surveys, and a total of 1.2M of gameplay distributed across 1.3M. Digital trace data was sourced for five distinct platforms—Xbox, Nintendo, Steam, iOS, and Android—through distinct piplines detailed below. The data collection methods were preregistered as part of a Stage 1 registered report (https://osf.io/pb5nu).\nThe dataset is openly available under a CC0 license at https://example.com for unrestricted reuse.

We screened participants from two panel sources: PureProfile and Prolific.\nParticipants were recruited under an initial set of ethnicity‐based quotas designed to mirror the general population’s demographic composition. After we reached approximately 50% of our target sample under quota constraints and found that further quota‐eligible recruits were scarce, we suspended the quotas for the remainder of data collection; all subsequent participants were enrolled on a first‐come, first‐served basis. Final sample characteristic reflect both quota‐driven and open‐enrollment phases (see below).\n\n\nStage 2: Account Linking\nParticipants who were deemed eligible during screening proceeded directly to an account linking survey wherein they provided details of the gaming platforms they actively use. For UK participants, this includes Nintendo Switch, Steam, Android and iOS. For US participants, this includes the same four alongside Xbox. Details of how participants linked each type of account are shown in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Platform Details\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                Platform\n                Data Source\n                Account Linking Process\n                Type of Data Collected\n              \n        \n        a See https://accounts.nintendo.com/qrcode.\nb In previous research, Nintendo-published games accounted for 65% of Switch playtime [\\@BallouEtAl2025Perceived].\nc See https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/guide-to-insider-program.\n        \n                \n                  Nintendo\n                  Data-sharing agreements with Nintendo of America (US) and Nintendo of Europe (UK)\n                  Participants share an identifier contained within a QR code on Nintendo web interface.

Participants who did not have recent, valid telemetry on any console platform were excluded from the rest of the study.\n\n\nStage 4: Surveys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\n\nEligible participants were invited to complete 6 waves of biweekly surveys, one every two weeks (Figure 2). US participants were additionally invited to complete daily surveys for 30 days, concurrently with the first biweekly surveys. During waves 1, 3, and 5, a cognitive task was also administered within the biweekly survey.\nDaily survey links were sent every day at 2pm local time for the participant and remained available until 3am. Biweekly survey links were sent every second week from the first day of the study at 12pm and remained available for 96 hours."

However, the demographics of console video game players are not well-understood; it is likely that our sample more closely represents this population than the general population."

To recap, on Xbox and Nintendo, we have session-level data, characterized by the following fields: a game ID (Xbox) or title (Nintendo), a start and end time, and genre(s). On Steam we have hourly aggregates - every hour, how much time people spent playing for all games they played in that hour. On iOS and Android, we have daily aggregates - every day, how much time people spent playing each game. We describe each platform in more detail below. For concision, we do not repeat the details of Table 2 in here, but direct readers to that table or our supplementary materials for the exact variables in each platform’s trace data.\nAll telemetry timestamps are stored as UTC, but can be converted to the participant’s local time using the local_timezone variable."

    "text": "Attention Control\nIn study waves 1, 3, and 5 we measured participants’ attention control using the Simon Squared task of Burgoyne et al. (2023), using modified code from Liceralde & Burgoyne (2023). Although the original Squared tasks consist of the Simon, Stroop, and Flanker Squared, due to limited participation time we chose to only use the Simon Squared task as it had the greatest factor loading on attention control in the original study (Burgoyne et al., 2023).\nThe Simon Squared task is a short and validated measure of attention control that follows the standard Simon task (Simon & Rudell, 1967) but is completed in about three minutes. Participants see a target arrow pointing either left or right, with response labels “LEFT” and “RIGHT” printed underneath. Participants then must select the response option (e.g. “LEFT”) that matches the arrow’s direction (e.g. ◀︎). However, the arrow and response options can appear on either side of the screen, and participants must ignore this spatial configuration and attend only to the symbols’ meanings.\nAfter reading the instructions, participants practice for 30 seconds with auditory and text feedback for response accuracy. They then see their score from the practice trials, review the instructions again, and are given 90 seconds to gain as many points as possible. Participants gain one point for each correct response, and lose one point for each incorrect response. After the 90 seconds, the number of correct responses minus the number of incorrect responses is the participant’s task score. For a complete task description, see Burgoyne et al. (2023) and Figure 6 therein."

    "text": "Limitations\nWhile this dataset represents a substantial step forward in holistic coverage of video game play, it remains imperfect: we did not capture data on PlayStation (~19% of gaming market) or computer games played outside the Steam platform (~11% of gaming market); on Nintendo, we do not have access to third-party titles (42% of Nintendo play), and our coverage of smartphone play is limited by the difficulties and inconsistencies of screenshot-based donation and OCR retrieval.\nWe further are unable to identify idle time (when players have a game open but are not actively playing it) and account sharing (when players let friends or family use their account); some playtime values may therefore be overestimates of the person’s true playtime, though we are unable to say by how much."

    "section": "Future Work",
    "text": "Future Work\nThe trace data presented here is broad in scope but limited in granularity: we capture all gaming activity on a given platform, but not what happens within individual games. Prior work and theory make clear that in-game behaviors (e.g., what role a player adopts, whether they compete or cooperate, or how they perform in competitive modes) are critical determinants of player experience and thereby wellbeing (see e.g., Elson et al. (2014) for a review of how in-game contexts shape effects). This highlights a fundamental trade-off in digital trace research between breadth—how comprehensively play can be captured across platforms—and depth—the granularity of in-game behaviors and experiences. At present, our dataset emphasizes breadth, but we see strong potential in future study designs that combine platform-level telemetry with targeted in-game behavioral data to provide a more complete picture.\nWe also see strong potential in combining digital trace data with experimental designs that enable stronger causal inference—for example, randomizing players to single-player games only, or restricting play to certain times of day, to examine effects on social wellbeing or sleep. Previous researchers have noted a dearth of digital trace data-backed field experiments, while highlighting their potential (Stier et al., 2020): Trace data not only captures naturalistic gaming behavior but also allows researchers to assess substitution (what games or platforms participants switch to under intervention) and adherence (how closely they follow assigned play patterns)."
